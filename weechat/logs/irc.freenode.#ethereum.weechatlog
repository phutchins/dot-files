2018-05-07 19:58:29	jcarpenter2	HMMMMMMMMMMMM, i say loudly
2018-05-07 19:59:14	jcarpenter2	see here, i've called a contract method and appended some meta-data to the DATA field of the ethereum transaction https://etherscan.io/tx/0x60cb8de821ab6488f9cb44d63fb7634867db3514754440755d5e83b75e213769
2018-05-07 19:59:52	jcarpenter2	the DATA field consists of a well-formed call to a contract method, followed by 'DEADBEEF', and it went through perfectly fine
2018-05-07 20:00:36	jcarpenter2	i'm thinking of using this as a way to attach some application-specific meta-data to ERC20 token transactions -- for example, appending the order number of an online order to the data field

2018-05-09 15:22:37	sig	it's probably not as bad though
2018-05-09 15:22:54	sig	things like getting your messages served in the order they appeared
2018-05-09 15:22:58	sig	not so simple on gitter
2018-05-09 15:23:08	Alpha64	gitter is like the kind of chat app somebody would post on jsbin

2018-05-09 15:23:31	sig	which is curious really, since I bet there already are a million and two chat apps to choose from

2018-05-09 17:05:14	jmares	This question has been bugging me - I think I see a future for Ethereum but how can it be said to be decentralized when there are always going to be a minority of a handful of powerful stakeholders which own most of the coins?
2018-05-09 17:05:43	Alpha64	decentralization doesn't imply equality
2018-05-09 17:05:45	jmares	eg. right now with the biggest mining pools, or in the hypothetical future with proof of stake, the "1%" really controlling the network
2018-05-09 17:06:01	Alpha64	having four kings doesn't make things nice for the pawns
2018-05-09 17:06:15	jmares	So four kings is not really decentralized, right?

2018-05-09 17:06:27	Alpha64	the problem is that if they really do control the network then people can migrate to some other coin
2018-05-09 17:06:37	jmares	Via a fork?
2018-05-09 17:06:47	Alpha64	all the incentives and game theory stuff is about this
2018-05-09 17:06:56	Alpha64	people will stay as long as it benefits them
2018-05-09 17:07:04	Alpha64	a fork or something else
2018-05-09 17:07:09	jmares	Slow down for my noob mind :)

2018-05-09 17:10:31	jmares	For an uneducated mind, how would one switch to litecoin?
2018-05-09 17:10:35	Alpha64	on an exchange
2018-05-09 17:10:45	Alpha64	or trading with somebody directly

2018-05-09 17:11:15	jmares	Hm! GOt it, thanks
2018-05-09 17:11:32	jmares	Conversion fees perhaps a small price to pay for a benign future
2018-05-09 17:12:04	jmares	Well. Just like that my belief in the potential impact of blockchain is restored.
2018-05-09 17:12:05	Alpha64	they are pretty low
2018-05-09 17:13:33	jmares	Has Vitalik spoken about this specifically? He must have gone into detail on this, and eg. governance, in some talk. Any you could recommend?

2018-05-14 14:53:19	bumbar_	if i deploy a contract, with some secret stored in it, how can i view that secret?
2018-05-14 14:55:38	jonored	Not very secret if it's stored in a contract...
2018-05-14 14:56:44	bumbar_	even if it has a private attribute, anyone can see it?
2018-05-14 14:57:22	jonored	Yup. You can't access it programmatically from other contracts, but the whole "the variable needs to be written into the blockchain" kind of precludes any kind of secrecy.
2018-05-14 14:58:21	jonored	(you can put hashes of secrets in, of course, and then prove that the secret value you gave someone off-chain was the one whose hash you put on the chain, though.)

2018-05-15 05:42:17	raxbg	Hi, geth always fails with "Too many open files" error when trying to start a p2p server. It also warns about the same issue when trying to open transactions.rlp. "cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr" returns "4576    0       1644940" so there are plenty of available file descriptors on the system + plenty of free RAM. Do you have any idea how can I fix this? I tried v 1.8.7 and also the latest development version 1.8.9.

2018-05-17 13:56:05	limbo_	ToTheInternet: look at the documentation for your client (e.g. geth) and copy the account files from one to the other. Make a copy too.

2018-05-17 14:11:11	limbo_	someone235: I don't think block rewards are technically transactions. Avoids the problem of miners paying for something with block rewards and then mining on top of another block.
2018-05-17 14:13:47	someone235	limbo_, yeah, it's not associated directly to the fact that miner rewards is not a transaction, it's related to the fact that transactions in Ethereum do not use UTXOs
2018-05-17 14:14:12	ToTheInternet	limbo_: hm ok.. seems like this is not an easy thing to do with mist. thanks though!
2018-05-17 14:14:42	someone235	limbo_, and also to the fact that uncles get reward as well.
2018-05-17 14:18:16	someone235	limbo_, another question. Is there a way to see only input transactions for an address?
2018-05-17 14:18:30	someone235	limbo_, with a simple api, or block explorer
2018-05-17 14:18:58	limbo_	ToTheInternet: I think mist uses geth to access the network. Try looking where that stores its files.

2018-05-18 14:31:39	mmgen	Microbe: without an SSD geth won't sync?
2018-05-18 14:32:17	mmgen	I find that really stupid
2018-05-18 14:32:39	mmgen	bitcoind syncs just fine without an SSD, for example
2018-05-18 14:33:07	Microbe	it's not by design, but as far as I've understood it just happens to be like that currently
2018-05-18 14:33:23	mmgen	Microbe: because of blockchain congestion probably
2018-05-18 14:33:41	mmgen	Microbe: thanks for the heads up! I suspected that might have something to do with it

2018-05-18 14:34:06	Microbe	and comparison to bitcoin is not very fair. bitcoin's block time is something like 10 minutes
2018-05-18 14:34:37	pelastiki_	what's the size of an ethereum full node at the moment ?
2018-05-18 14:34:44	Microbe	it means your client has 10 minutes to receive all the relevant info. compared to ethereum's ~12 seconds
2018-05-18 14:34:48	Microbe	umh, unsure
2018-05-18 14:34:54	mmgen	Microbe: In my opinion, relaying transactions before the node is synced is a design flaw
2018-05-18 14:35:17	mmgen	pelastiki_: 75 GB
2018-05-18 14:35:24	Microbe	no way, much bigger.
2018-05-18 14:35:27	pelastiki_	non - pruned ?
2018-05-18 14:35:41	mmgen	pelastiki_: that's with --fast
2018-05-18 14:35:56	pelastiki_	and without it ?
2018-05-18 14:35:57	mmgen	pelastiki_: non-pruned I don't know
2018-05-18 14:36:20	Microbe	looks like fast sync is 70gb
2018-05-18 14:36:43	mmgen	Microbe: strangely enough, the node did a full IBD in about 18 hrs
2018-05-18 14:37:01	mmgen	Microbe: it just won't go that last mile though
2018-05-18 14:37:45	pelastiki_	u need an ssd I think, the same happened to me last year when I tried to sync it !
2018-05-18 14:37:57	mmgen	pelastiki_: thanks!
2018-05-18 14:38:07	Microbe	mmgen: I'm not sure how the relaying protocol works, but I'd imagine it's able to pack multiple old blocks but new one can't be packed or something like that
2018-05-18 14:38:31	mmgen	Microbe: I see
2018-05-18 14:38:50	mmgen	Microbe: the cut-off appears to be around 70-100 blocks from the chain tip
2018-05-18 14:39:08	mmgen	That's 10-15 minutes
2018-05-18 14:39:08	Microbe	especially the very last block is difficult to catch as the target switches. and if your I/O can't keep up you can never get fully synced
2018-05-18 14:39:31	Microbe	yeah, don't really know why it's like that
2018-05-18 14:39:35	mmgen	Microbe: can a node 100 blocks behind still send transactions?
2018-05-18 14:39:36	Microbe	just guessing here.
2018-05-18 14:40:05	Microbe	I can't think of a reason why zero-synced node couldn't send transactions
2018-05-18 14:40:14	mmgen	Microbe: yeah, I thought it might be i/o
2018-05-18 14:40:32	mmgen	Microbe: re tx: thanks.  I'll give it a try
2018-05-18 14:40:48	mmgen	Microbe: being 10 minutes behind isn't really a problem for me
2018-05-18 14:41:09	Microbe	yeah. you just can't mine obviously, but otherwise it might not be a problem
2018-05-18 14:41:25	Microbe	aaaand you have to wait for tx results if you interact with the chain
2018-05-18 14:41:37	mmgen	Microbe: well of course
2018-05-18 14:41:59	mmgen	Microbe: I'm a Bitcoiner, so I'm used to waiting ;)

2018-05-21 09:16:36	jmares	smk that would make sense, I was just concerned because in the white paper it said that the gas costs are deducted from the sender account first. So if the transaction tries to send the original balance, it wont be enough. Transaction won't take place and yet gas costs will be incurred.
2018-05-21 09:17:07	jmares	Perhaps it's a bit of an edge case, since most people won't be sending their entire balance to another account.
