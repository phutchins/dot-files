2018-09-20 11:30:21	phutchins	Hey all, I have a a node that is connected through a proxy. The ZBX box under Availability is grey even though it does have passive checks on it. It is not red however. It is alerting for zabbix agent unreachable. When the zabbix agent on the client starts up, it says 'cannot send list of active checks to "...": host [hostname] not found'. Connectivity between the nodes (client, proxy, server) all look good.
2018-09-20 11:30:21	phutchins	Any suggestions where to look next?
2018-09-20 11:30:48	troffasky	check what hostname you set for the node in zabbix
2018-09-20 11:30:55	troffasky	[the web interface]
2018-09-20 11:31:00	Croso	Working with phutchins on the same issue, hostnames nmatch across the board.
2018-09-20 11:31:03	troffasky	that will be what doesn't match
2018-09-20 11:31:35	Croso	Even did the old unix, make sure its not an O vs a 0 check lol
2018-09-20 11:31:42	troffasky	you could cheat and create an Auto registration action
2018-09-20 11:32:04	Croso	We also have an auto registration action
2018-09-20 11:32:21	Croso	templates that are being used work for other systems in the same network with the same configuration and OS
2018-09-20 11:32:30	Richlv	phutchins, passive only or active items on it?
2018-09-20 11:32:50	Richlv	how long ago was the host added/linked to the template?
2018-09-20 11:32:52	Croso	Poller process on the proxy are kind of maxed out if that helps
2018-09-20 11:32:57	phutchins	It has items that are type Zabbix Agent so i believe that means that there are passive items, yes?
2018-09-20 11:32:59	Richlv	active or passive proxy?
2018-09-20 11:33:01	Croso	(above 75%)
2018-09-20 11:33:15	Richlv	phutchins, ok, so let's assume no active items then
2018-09-20 11:33:32	Richlv	Croso, it should still work ok at 75%, mostly
2018-09-20 11:34:03	Richlv	ok, waiting for info on all questions i asked so far :)
2018-09-20 11:34:17	Croso	Error on agent is "no active checks found for hostname" and error on Zabbix proxy is host not found
2018-09-20 11:34:26	phutchins	Proxy mode is set to 0 so active, It was whatever the default is before but I set it to 0 at recommendation of something I read...
2018-09-20 11:34:40	phutchins	Richlv: ^
2018-09-20 11:35:35	phutchins	Yeah, should jsut be passive Items I think. Well, there is one UserParameter item at the bottom of the config on the client. I could remove it however for testing.
2018-09-20 11:35:44	Croso	@Richlv host has been added and linked to template several times (we've tried removing and readding the host several times).  Timeframe passed is days to minutes.

2018-09-20 11:37:37	Richlv	are any other hosts monitored though that proxy successfully?
2018-09-20 11:38:00	Richlv	phutchins, active is the default, so explicitly setting that was redundant (but no harm)
2018-09-20 11:38:12	Croso	Whats interesting is, we discovered this after the proxy was down for some time, got proxy back up and half the hosts that are configured the same fell right in no issue, and a random selection of the other half are having this issue
2018-09-20 11:38:15	Richlv	Croso, "no active checks found for hostname" you can ignore if you have no active checks

2018-09-20 11:40:50	Croso	agent looks to be 2.4.7 and Proxy is 3.2.3.  We dismissed this mismatch as there are quite a few of the identical systems that are working, but could be wrong? *shrug*
2018-09-20 11:42:21	_ikke_	should be working
2018-09-20 11:42:28	_ikke_	We've been using 2.4 for a long time on 3.x

2018-09-20 11:57:56	phutchins	Is there something that we can do to manually check host name? Given they look identical from UI and config :-\
2018-09-20 11:58:28	LarryD	putchins - One could go do manual queries against the DB, but I would trust Zabbix is displaying what is in the DB...
2018-09-20 11:58:29	phutchins	The proxy also alerts "cannot send list of active checks to "10.142.X.X": host [myhost] not found"
2018-09-20 11:58:36	phutchins	LarryD: yeah...
2018-09-20 11:59:00	LarryD	Is selinux involved?  Have you tried turning off firewall?
2018-09-20 11:59:09	LarryD	(just for testing)
2018-09-20 11:59:52	phutchins	LarryD: we have done to a point but let us try it again just to be sure...
2018-09-20 12:00:02	phutchins	We have other nodes goign through the same proxy that are green FYI
2018-09-20 12:00:10	phutchins	and the configs between them look the same :-\
2018-09-20 12:00:53	LarryD	I also have a questions...  stock Zabbix VMware monitoring.  The item "vmware.hv.cpu.usage" is collecting every 5 minutes, but it's getting the exact same value for hours at a time.  Looking at the graphs on vmware shows a lot of variation...  thoughts on where/how to start digging?

2018-09-20 12:01:49	LarryD	phutchins - have you compared the zabbix_agentd.conf on the 'bad' host to one on a 'good' host?
2018-09-20 12:02:12	phutchins	yep
2018-09-20 12:02:14	phutchins	identical
2018-09-20 12:02:50	phutchins	I've also tried changing the server and ServerActive with IP address instead of DNS name
2018-09-20 12:03:22	LarryD	Have you deleted the host out of Zabbix and set it back up?
2018-09-20 12:04:19	phutchins	LarryD: yep. a number of times. We weren't sure if somehow it was getting stuck in the proxy however (or if thats even a thing)
2018-09-20 12:04:39	phutchins	but it did disappear from the GUI and when we started it back up it registered against the server
2018-09-20 12:08:39	LarryD	What testing have you done from the proxy since that is what will be talking to that host?  Can you ping that host from the proxy?  Can you ping the proxy from that host?
2018-09-20 12:09:36	LarryD	You could also configure the host to not use a proxy temporarily to categorically implicate or absolve it...
2018-09-20 12:10:28	phutchins	Yeah that was my thought as well to test like that. Let me check connectivity once more to confirm...
2018-09-20 12:10:46	LarryD	troffasky - you're using vmware monitoring...  do you see the CPU values changing with each check or are you getting the same value back for long periods of time?
2018-09-20 12:11:06	troffasky	yeah saw your Q. LarryD, just checking...
2018-09-20 12:11:23	LarryD	My value does change, but infrequently...
2018-09-20 12:12:11	phutchins	LarryD: so from the client, I can telnet to the proxy on port 10050 and 10051. (on 10050, it doesn't keep a connection and I get connection closed by foreign host, however that means that the firewall is open). 
2018-09-20 12:12:15	troffasky	yeah, definitely changing on the first one i checked
2018-09-20 12:12:26	phutchins	From the proxy I can connect to both 10050 and 10051 on the client and both connections stay open.

2018-09-20 12:14:38	Croso	tcpdump shows the proxy and agent are communicating back and forth
2018-09-20 12:14:53	phutchins	Also, I can connect from the proxy back to the zabbix server on both 10050 and 10051.
2018-09-20 12:15:42	phutchins	The proxy is configured in the zabbix server with an internal IP so it would only be able to reach out to the server, but not the zabbix server to proxy. Which I think should be fine with our setup.

2018-09-20 14:06:11	_ikke_	phew
2018-09-20 14:06:16	Richlv	but 2.4, as i discovered, is not :>
2018-09-20 14:06:26	Richlv	Croso, see above on version compatibility
2018-09-20 14:06:36	_ikke_	We just did a push to get all agents upgraded to 3.4
2018-09-20 14:06:45	_ikke_	(we already rolled it out, but some servers were still left behind)
2018-09-20 14:06:46	Richlv	Croso, and upgrade your proxy, it will likely help

2018-09-20 14:37:28	junixbr	no, I didn't
2018-09-20 14:37:36	junixbr	let me do this
2018-09-20 14:39:00	junixbr	hey!!! it works!
2018-09-20 14:39:04	junixbr	=-O
2018-09-20 14:39:17	junixbr	my problem was the filter
2018-09-20 14:40:17	_ikke_	yeah, that was most likely the issue if nothing shows and error but nothing shows up either
2018-09-20 14:40:23	junixbr	but, is it wrong? how is the correct way to filter?
2018-09-20 14:40:33	junixbr	ahhhh ok

2018-09-20 14:42:18	junixbr	but it is showing to me the drive E too
2018-09-20 14:42:23	junixbr	without filter
2018-09-20 14:42:26	_ikke_	yes
2018-09-20 14:42:31	_ikke_	so I see you have quotes there
2018-09-20 14:42:49	_ikke_	they are not necessary and will not work (prevent the filter from working)
2018-09-20 14:43:08	_ikke_	so just ^(C|D|F|G)

2018-09-20 16:01:19	LarryD	 So I've setup one of my vmware hypervisors to be monitored identically both by my prod instance of Zabbix and my alpha instance of Zabbix.  (This is troubleshooting getting the same value repeatedly for CPU, maybe other items.)
2018-09-20 16:01:37	LarryD	Both instances are getting repeated values, but the two instances are not getting the same repeated value...
2018-09-20 16:01:39	LarryD	ugh
2018-09-20 16:03:25	phutchins	Anyone know if it's OK to nuke the DB of the proxy?
2018-09-20 16:03:57	phutchins	Even after creating our firewall rules from scratch, that host still won't turn green lol
2018-09-20 16:05:48	LarryD	phutchins - no config data is kept in proxy db... it's all just transient data.  So... yes, you can nuke it and reload the schemas it needs.
2018-09-20 16:06:02	LarryD	You might lose some data that is in-flight, but that should be all...
2018-09-20 16:06:26	_ikke_	phutchins: do you get data?
2018-09-20 16:09:57	Richlv	phutchins, did you get my messages?

2018-09-20 16:16:00	LarryD	So I've cranked up the logging on the vmware collector and it looks like it is processing data for everything on my vcenter and not just the single hypervisor I told it to monitor.  Does that seem legit?
2018-09-20 16:18:56	Richlv	not aware of the detail. maybe the api doesn't allow selecting the info right away?

2018-09-20 16:27:43	_ikke_	they need to be the same major version

2018-09-20 16:29:08	Richlv	yep
2018-09-20 16:29:14	Richlv	no point debugging it further
2018-09-20 16:29:20	Richlv	it's just not supported
2018-09-20 16:29:34	Richlv	data sync might work, but beyond that it's all wacky
2018-09-20 16:29:39	phutchins	Ok so our server is 3.4.11, proxy is 3.2.3, and the broken agent is 3.0.7 (given this agent worked when directly connecting to the zabbix server)
