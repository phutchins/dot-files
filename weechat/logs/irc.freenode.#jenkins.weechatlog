2018-04-26 11:17:40	phutchins	Good morning
2018-04-26 11:18:04	phutchins	Anyone use the go plugin for jenkins with a Jenkins file? I'm having trouble getting it to work. It's installing go but then not able to find the go binary.
2018-04-26 11:18:21	phutchins	It doesn't seem to be setting the GOPATH like it claims it does.
2018-04-26 11:18:24	tang^	kakawait: considered using a single sh step? or blue ocean?

2018-04-26 11:19:52	kakawait	tang^ considered as single sh step is not possible because `sh` comes from Shared Library. And blue ocean output is not better than Jenkins vanilla
2018-04-26 11:20:13	+batmat	I would tend to say: IRC is better suite for live help for diagnosing unclear issues or so. But if you're not in an actual hurry, or even so, the best luck is generally the users ML. I think it's probably used by an order of magnitudes more people too (I might be wrong)
2018-04-26 11:20:26	+batmat	s/suite/suited
2018-04-26 11:20:33	tang^	kakawait: ahh, multiple library calls each with their own sh step?
2018-04-26 11:21:04	kakawait	batman I understand I will try ML next time

2018-04-26 11:22:14	kakawait	no just single shared library that calling multiple `sh` but I could stop annoying you for now and switch to ML/stack I have no prob with that
2018-04-26 11:22:21	+batmat	tang^: you might experienced enough to find your way through using those
2018-04-26 11:22:31	kakawait	and I think with picture it will be more easy to understand
2018-04-26 11:22:37	+batmat	again, I might be wrong, but I think real beginners might have better chances on the users ML

2018-04-26 13:31:41	cyrus_mc	Looking for some assistance on how I might accomplish passing information between builds. I have one job that is essentially the CI portion (builds, tests, packages). The next job is the actual deployment. The build job calls the deploy job and passes it information via parameters (about what the new version is, what env to deploy to, etc).

2018-04-26 13:32:48	cyrus_mc	The problem with that is, if I just want to run the deploy job I need to manually set the parameters just as the last successfull build version. Is there a way I can pass this info between the jobs. I am thinking the copy artifact but in this case it isn't an actual artifact but rather some metadata

2018-04-26 13:59:32	cyrus_mc	What I think I am going to do is archive the package.json (as that contains the metadata about the last build). The downstream will grab that and parse

No one is about to spend time on such a feature; the `withDockerContainer` step should be considered take it or leave it: it works OK for some simple common use cases, and is useless for other cases.

Can't find anything useful) my actual and incomplete finding : http://i.imgur.com/lkpUtJe.png
2018-04-27 10:18:26	+jglick	kkurasz: I do not maintain this plugin any more (that would be abayer or ndeloof), and I suspect they do not have the resources to evaluate PRs for in this code area, since in practice every change introduces critical regressions. IMHO `withDockerStep` is best frozen in its current state and deprecated.
2018-04-27 10:22:55	petererer	Hmm, if I upgrade Jenkins, then the gitea plugin "forgets" that it is meant to be using ssh for git checkout and reverts back to https. However the config is still there. Once the config is removed and reapplied, it starts working again.

2018-04-27 10:44:58	kkurasz	Guest65070: You just missed my docker question.  I'm new to docker and jenkins overall, but if this helps, the recommendation to me was to ignore the docker-workflow plugin and run the docker commandline from the pipeline directly
2018-04-27 10:46:35	kkurasz	Guest65070: FWIW, I'm running under windows which makes the docker-workflow plugin far less useful.
2018-04-27 10:47:43	Guest65070	Hmmm, interesting. Basically just trying to figure out how to clean up the workspace after the pipeline run and want to remove the container at the end without destroying other containers on the same node
2018-04-27 10:50:28	Guest65070	Don't think the workspace cleanup plugin does it unless I'm mistaken?

2018-04-27 11:28:02	+jglick	in fact that is *all* `withRun` does
2018-04-27 11:28:40	+jglick	it is just a shortcut for `try`…`finally` (or if externalized to, say, a Bash script, `trap 'docker rm -f $CID' EXIT`)

2018-04-27 14:06:05	jameskleeh	No
2018-04-27 14:07:42	Guest65070	Can I assume it's a multi-branch pipeline job?
2018-04-27 14:08:10	jameskleeh	its a simple job that listens to commits on git and executes a gradle build
2018-04-27 14:08:36	Guest65070	Yeah I would cleanup the workspace as the final stage.
2018-04-27 14:09:00	jameskleeh	Is that an option in the build configuration?
2018-04-27 14:09:07	Guest65070	Also assuming your publishing your artifacts?
2018-04-27 14:09:25	jameskleeh	Yes
2018-04-27 14:09:56	jameskleeh	I don't need any local data other than the logs, etc after the build is finished
2018-04-27 14:10:21	Guest65070	So it is an option to cleanup the workspace after each build
2018-04-27 14:10:52	jameskleeh	I see "Delete workspace before build starts"
2018-04-27 14:11:14	Guest65070	Yes.
2018-04-27 14:11:30	Guest65070	If you were doing this in pipeline you could just simply call this in a stage step([$class: 'WsCleanup'])

2018-04-27 14:12:51	neilhwatson	there's a builtin cleanup stage in post.
2018-04-27 14:13:26	@abayer	neilhwatson: The cleanup post condition doesn't actually do anything automatically - it just runs *after* all other post conditions regardless of build status.

2018-04-27 14:15:37	neilhwatson	cleanup is a good name. It suggests its use. Finally is just sarcastic :)

2018-04-27 14:15:58	kkurasz	Is using deleteDir() at the start of your pipeline considered bad form?
2018-04-27 14:16:17	Guest65070	Do you guys know if the container is removed after it's done with the docker.inside? Or if the wscleanup will remove it?
2018-04-27 14:16:17	kkurasz	our 'checkout' stage is deleteDir() followed by checkout scm
2018-04-27 14:16:26	@abayer	Well, in Declarative, it's gonna delete the automatic checkout scm it does before entering the first stage.
2018-04-27 14:17:07	kkurasz	ok, so we are doubling up on scm checkouts

2018-04-27 14:34:43	dnusbaum	but here it seems fine as long as CSLS doesn't have a super weird serialized form since CSLM is already whitelisted as you noted
2018-04-27 14:35:15	 *	jglick As I noted in the PR, CSLM was likely added in response to an actual problem. No code should *deliberately* serialize any of these types.

2018-04-27 14:36:47	musigma	I know it's too late to avoid it, but I'd go as far as to avoid serialization in general and use something schema-based like avro :)

2018-04-28 07:57:47	+batmat	RE: "batmat could you clarify why https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3408 needs to wait until the weekly is out?"
2018-04-28 07:58:44	+batmat	danielbeck: a poor-man approach to serialize changes in two different weeklies and have a better immediate way to know it cannot be some change, merged on N+1 version, when the first is in N
2018-04-28 07:59:04	+batmat	N being https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3410
2018-04-28 07:59:11	+batmat	N+1 https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3408
2018-04-28 07:59:49	+batmat	not that strongly opinionated about that though. I you wish/think https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3408 should me merged asap (i.e. before tomorrow) that's also acceptable to me

2018-04-30 14:04:57	boxrick	I am here its mostly working, but getting multiple stages within each parallel is a little confusing
2018-04-30 14:04:58	boxrick	https://gist.github.com/boxrick/30315ac1f03af4723e2ab4472a276f14
2018-04-30 14:05:31	boxrick	So far that executes on two of my nodes in parallel which is good, but I need to split that provision step into a separate stage.
2018-04-30 14:06:02	@abayer	boxrick: That's not possible yet - waiting on https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/pull/227, which should hopefully land and get released in May.
2018-04-30 14:06:02	boxrick	But the mix of declarative and scripted is confusion
2018-04-30 14:06:07	boxrick	confusing*
2018-04-30 14:06:16	boxrick	Oh ok fair enough
2018-04-30 14:06:26	boxrick	So can I hack around it somehow?
2018-04-30 14:07:44	boxrick	The way travis handles this is quite elegent
2018-04-30 14:07:52	@abayer	We're getting there. =)
2018-04-30 14:08:42	boxrick	https://github.com/boxrick/ansible-ntp/blob/master/.travis.yml <-- in this particular case, but trying to 'Jenkinsify' it
2018-04-30 14:09:55	@abayer	boxrick: fwiw, if you're running each parallel branch in one agent, you don't strictly *need* to break it up into multiple stages. For now, I'd say just go with the single stage per branch.
2018-04-30 14:11:05	boxrick	I need to perform a bunch of different tests, so my single stage just becomes a little large
2018-04-30 14:11:27	@abayer	boxrick: Yeah, definitely not ideal, but functional until JENKINS-46809 (that PR I linked) lands.

2018-04-30 14:11:49	boxrick	Any way I can backport that in ?
2018-04-30 14:12:03	@abayer	I'd strongly advise against that - it really won't be too long.

2018-05-01 12:15:18	cyrus_mc	Looking for some advice on how to run different pipelines (for the same repository) based on branch name. For example, for master and PR-# I want to run the CI portion. For release-# branches deployment. My only thought now is to have a single pipeline and have lots of IF logic in each stage, which would make it really ugly and hard to follow
2018-05-01 12:15:45	cyrus_mc	My ideal solution would be to have separate Jenkinsfile (ie: Jenkinsfile.ci and Jenkinsfile.cd) that is called depending on the branch name. Is something like that possible?

In non-blue ocean it shows the stages correctly. In blue Ocean it just collapses everything to one stage, that stage being Load Build.
2018-05-01 13:48:33	cyrus_mc	I initially tried just having the load statement in Jenkinsfile but that error as you require a node statement
2018-05-01 13:49:24	musigma	you can allocate a node inside a node I'm pretty sure
2018-05-01 13:50:30	cyrus_mc	musigma: I do that if you see master.groovy. I create another node. Might just be a blue ocean issue in the way it tries to represent the stages

2018-05-01 13:51:14	cyrus_mc	Looking at this example : https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-examples/blob/master/pipeline-examples/load-from-file/pipeline.groovy - although I am not sure how this works, as how does it find the file to load. I initially tried this but it said couldn't find master.groovy so I had to checkout the source first

2018-05-01 15:00:49	jiangty	I have a job that seems to have gone into an infinite loop; it's output 340GB (!!!!!!) of logs. Killing it through the UI doesn't work. Is there a safe way to kill the job / delete the logs?
2018-05-01 15:01:28	jiangty	(maybe not infinite, but a very very long loop, at the very least)
2018-05-01 15:01:57	dnusbaum	Bonjourno: In Jenkins you would go to the plugin management page, then the advanced tab, and find the upload plugin button (maybe it's called upload hpi) and just upload the file you downloaded from that link. It will install everything automatically

2018-05-02 09:46:05	-->	dougsland (douglas@nat/redhat/x-rqwrpqocoewtobql) has joined #jenkins
2018-05-02 09:46:09	ahadi	I tag my images with multiple tags, for example with the commit hash and with something like 'latest-master' or 'latest-develop', so with branch names. If I push it using docker, the image is pushed only once but tagged with all provided tags. In Pipeline I currently need to call the push method of the image multiple times, which costs significant build time

2018-05-02 11:19:15	@abayer	Yeah, think it was him. My "what I wish we had" scenario is no Scripted, just Declarative, don't really care what the format of the Declarative Pipeline is - could be Groovy-esque like it is now, could be YAML, main thing is not ever actually exposing arbitrary scripting capabilities.
2018-05-02 11:19:23	farley_	thinking ^^ is a bug, but wanted to confirm
2018-05-02 11:19:29	musigma	there was a period of a few days where I was like, man, kotlin pipelines would be dope, but then I talked about it with someone and had it pointed out that complex pipelines would be a nightmare to maintain

2018-05-02 11:20:05	musigma	pretty sure it was inspired by how I prefer sbt to gradle, but that's only because they're both limited and require you to do some scripting it seems

2018-05-03 08:20:59	pmmaga	from there you have a couple options. the easiest but less fancy would be to rsync the result of your build to your web server

2018-05-03 08:26:32	bubo	In shared library, do you have to pass all variables to a function or is it possible for the function to use the variables that are defined in the pipeline??

2018-05-03 13:31:31	boxrick	If i could pass in the variable as a parameter that would also prove sufficient
2018-05-03 13:31:46	boxrick	In a similar vein to ${job} but I am unsure of the syntax.
2018-05-03 13:32:00	boxrick	I dont quite understand how it iterates over all the values inside job even really.
2018-05-03 13:32:16	boxrick	config.distros *
2018-05-03 13:32:47	tang^	I think body.delegate = config; body(); unwraps the variables so they just become distro and agent_type
2018-05-03 13:33:24	@abayer	Basically, any variables in the shared library outside the scope of the pipeline {} block won't actually resolve in the execution of the pipeline {} block.
2018-05-03 13:33:37	@abayer	I believe.
2018-05-03 13:34:17	tang^	no, they should be accessible as config.variable
2018-05-03 13:34:43	@abayer	tang^: Things get weird with Declarative in a shared library, though - when we're actually executing it, it's in a context that doesn't know about the config var.
2018-05-03 13:34:48	tang^	your script looks like it was based on https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/10/02/pipeline-templates-with-shared-libraries/
2018-05-03 13:35:20	tang^	abayer: that article suggests that they should be available

2018-05-03 13:35:39	@abayer	Hrm, it might be due to being in the gstring? Not sure. This is a use case I've never liked much. =)

After some time (1-5 minutes), the instance is no longer reachable, requests just time out. The server is idle and has enough free memory during this time. Network-io and disk-io are at almost zero. What could be the problem?

2018-05-04 22:21:01	MG	guys i'm quite stumped
2018-05-04 22:21:06	MG	I have a pipe
2018-05-04 22:21:24	teletype	spark it up
2018-05-04 22:21:24	MG	and in that pipe I am doign some rspec testing (ruby)
2018-05-04 22:21:30	MG	lol
2018-05-04 22:21:33	MG	I wish
2018-05-04 22:21:33	MG	lol
2018-05-04 22:21:46	MG	 script.sshagent (credentials: ['githubrepoclonekey']) {                                     //script.sh("sleep 6000000")                                     script.sh 'bundle install'                                 }
2018-05-04 22:22:04	MG	I'm trying to push my github key down into the pipe
2018-05-04 22:22:21	teletype	to install gems from a private repo?
2018-05-04 22:22:22	MG	cause my Gemfile does this :
2018-05-04 22:22:26	MG	yes
2018-05-04 22:22:28	MG	exactly
2018-05-04 22:22:54	MG	gem 'respectful', git: 'git@github.com:MYORG/respectful.git', tag: '0.2.0'
2018-05-04 22:23:02	MG	and I'm getting nowhere
2018-05-04 22:23:20	MG	I use that same key -> githubrepoclonekey
2018-05-04 22:23:41	MG	in other places like this ->        git url: projectUrl, branch: projectBranch, credentialsId: "githubrepoclonekey"
2018-05-04 22:24:14	MG	that work for checking my project out from the same pipe code
2018-05-04 22:24:28	teletype	hrm if you are using ssh credentials for github i can't see why agent wouldn't work.
2018-05-04 22:25:22	MG	it's driving me crazy
2018-05-04 22:25:26	MG	cause exactly
2018-05-04 22:26:50	teletype	did you try ssh-adding the key in a shell and running bundle install, to take jenkins out of the picture?
2018-05-04 22:27:02	MG	I don't know how to do that
2018-05-04 22:27:09	MG	so like this you mean ...
2018-05-04 22:27:48	MG	script.withCredentials([script.sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'githubrepoclonekey', keyFileVariable: 'gitrepokey', passphraseVariable: 'gitpassphrase', usernameVariable: 'gitusername')]) {
2018-05-04 22:28:01	MG	sh(returnStdout: true, script: "ssh-add \$gitrepokey")
2018-05-04 22:28:15	teletype	no i mean outside of jenkins... save the key to a file, run "eval $(ssh-agent)" and then ssh-add yourkeyfile, and then try the bundle install
2018-05-04 22:29:12	teletype	that would narrow your problem domain by 50%, right? if it works there, then it's a jenkins problem. if not then it's a problem with ruby interacting with ssh agent
2018-05-04 22:29:33	MG	if I create a container with that key in the container ... then the problem goes away

2018-05-04 22:29:49	MG	I was trying not to create containers with ssh keys in them
2018-05-04 22:29:54	teletype	you mean with the key saved to ~/.ssh/id_rsa or whatever in the container?
2018-05-04 22:29:57	MG	yes
2018-05-04 22:30:18	teletype	yes that's not the same though. i'm specifically saying save it to a non default place and try running an ssh-agent. because that is what jenkins is doing.
2018-05-04 22:30:42	MG	I original had my Dockerfile for this container put the key into /home/jenkins/.ssh ... and I had /home/jenkins/.ssh/config with this
2018-05-04 22:31:39	MG	Host github.com         User git         Hostname github.com         PreferredAuthentications publickey         IdentityFile /home/jenkins/.ssh/jenkins_new
2018-05-04 22:32:09	teletype	you shouldn't have to put keys in a dockerfile either btw. if you use sshagent step, jenkins will wire up the agent to work from within your docker container, using a key from jenkins credentials store
2018-05-04 22:32:17	MG	that's my point !
2018-05-04 22:32:18	MG	exactly
2018-05-04 22:32:42	MG	I change my Dockerfile to not put the keys into the container
2018-05-04 22:32:46	MG	or I should say image

2018-05-04 22:34:05	MG	-> do the setup you had but iwthout the IdentityFile configuration  <-
2018-05-04 22:34:23	MG	OHHHH
2018-05-04 22:34:30	teletype	yeah, instead of Identityfile /home/jenkins/.ssh/jenkins_new
2018-05-04 22:34:33	MG	create a .ssh/config file
2018-05-04 22:34:37	MG	and put this in it
2018-05-04 22:34:39	teletype	no, with no .ssh/config
2018-05-04 22:34:57	MG	ohhh you lost me
2018-05-04 22:35:01	teletype	just take that jenkins_new key and put it anywhere. run "eval $(ssh-agent)" to start ssh-agent, and then run "ssh-add /path/to/your/key/file"
2018-05-04 22:35:15	teletype	and then try running your bundler install
2018-05-04 22:35:44	MG	let me see if I follow
2018-05-04 22:36:02	teletype	you said it works if you use a local key file. i'm trying to help you determine whether it works using an ssh-agent connection, but outside of jenkins.
2018-05-04 22:36:26	MG	oh I can run "bundle install" outside of jenkins no problem
2018-05-04 22:36:36	teletype	right, but using a configured key file, right?
2018-05-04 22:36:40	MG	it's only when I do it in a pipe

2018-05-04 22:36:59	teletype	can you try commenting out the config that points to that key file
2018-05-04 22:37:03	MG	ok
2018-05-04 22:37:09	MG	I'll comment out that line
2018-05-04 22:37:13	teletype	and instead use the ssh agent commands
2018-05-04 22:37:14	MG	I'm on my mac
2018-05-04 22:37:41	MG	and I'm commenting that line out of my ~/.ssh/
2018-05-04 22:37:52	teletype	jenkins isn't passing an ssh config or anything. it's managing an ssh agent session, and setting the environment vars to talk to it for any steps inside its closure
2018-05-04 22:38:20	teletype	so testing ssh-agent outside of jenkins will tell you whether it's a jenkins issue or not
2018-05-04 22:39:08	MG	yeah I commented out that line in my ~?.ssh/config file
2018-05-04 22:39:16	MG	and when I do and then run "bundle install"
2018-05-04 22:39:40	teletype	it should fail if you haven't started the ssh agent

2018-05-04 22:40:36	MG	yeah exactly it fails
2018-05-04 22:40:45	MG	let me put the line back in and make sure
2018-05-04 22:40:49	teletype	right, so with that commented out, you can either try running "ssh-agent", and it will output some env vars and exports which you can paste back into your shell
2018-05-04 22:40:52	teletype	no, keep the line commented out
2018-05-04 22:41:06	teletype	you can either do that or you can run "eval $(ssh-agent)" and it will start the agent
2018-05-04 22:41:09	MG	ahhhh
2018-05-04 22:41:21	MG	ok yeah I was just making sure it was that line teletype
2018-05-04 22:41:35	MG	ok I'm commenting out the line again

2018-05-04 22:41:50	teletype	when the agent is running you can do "ssh-add -l" to list keys it knows about. if it says no identities, then do "ssh-add /path/to/your/keyfile"
2018-05-04 22:42:01	teletype	and then "ssh-add -l" should show your key file. if it does try the bundle install again
2018-05-04 22:42:21	teletype	if it still fails it's a ruby problem, if it works it's a jenkins problem
2018-05-04 22:42:22	MG	$ ssh-agent SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/var/folders/bl/4245fp8s44ggmvxq_104p0pnfch8hn/T//ssh-yyzGsJ39P19l/agent.44350; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=44351; export SSH_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 44351;
2018-05-04 22:42:48	teletype	yeah just paste all the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and export stuff back into your shell
2018-05-04 22:42:57	teletype	those vars tell ssh how to talk to the agent
2018-05-04 22:43:03	MG	ok I'm putting those back in
2018-05-04 22:43:05	MG	SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/var/folders/bl/4245fp8s44ggmvxq_104p0pnfch8hn/T//ssh-yyzGsJ39P19l/agent.44350; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=44351; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
2018-05-04 22:43:16	MG	ok and now what ...
2018-05-04 22:43:24	teletype	then "ssh-add -l" should tell you whether it sees the agent
2018-05-04 22:43:37	teletype	if it says no identities then ssh-add yourkeyfile
2018-05-04 22:43:39	MG	ssh-add -l The agent has no identities.
2018-05-04 22:43:46	MG	ok
2018-05-04 22:43:49	teletype	then ssh-add -l should show you your key file
2018-05-04 22:44:14	teletype	so then it's the same effect as the config you had, but ssh-agent is providing the key instead of reading the file directly. this is how it works in a pipeline
2018-05-04 22:44:32	MG	ssh-add  ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa Identity added: /Users/ME/.ssh/github_id_rsa (/Users/ME/.ssh/github_id_rsa)
2018-05-04 22:44:53	teletype	yep you are good, now see if bundle install works
2018-05-04 22:45:09	MG	now on my m,ac I should be able to do "bundle install" ? ... lol ... ok yes tryit it now
2018-05-04 22:45:25	MG	yes
2018-05-04 22:45:25	MG	work
2018-05-04 22:45:34	MG	Bundle complete! 13 Gemfile dependencies, 40 gems now installed.
2018-05-04 22:45:36	teletype	huh. that means it's a jenkins problem
2018-05-04 22:45:40	MG	ok so let me look at my history
2018-05-04 22:46:15	MG	  568  vi ~/.ssh/config
2018-05-04 22:46:21	MG	that's wher I commented out the identity
2018-05-04 22:46:23	MG	and then
2018-05-04 22:46:29	MG	ssh-agent
2018-05-04 22:46:33	teletype	i believe you =)
2018-05-04 22:46:42	MG	SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/var/folders/bl/4245fp8s44ggmvxq_104p0pnfch8hn/T//ssh-yyzGsJ39P19l/agent.44350; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=44351; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
2018-05-04 22:46:43	MG	and then I grabbed the output
2018-05-04 22:46:48	MG	and put that back in to the shell
2018-05-04 22:47:33	MG	ssh-add -l
2018-05-04 22:47:36	MG	tell me no identies ... ok ok
2018-05-04 22:47:38	MG	and then
2018-05-04 22:47:45	MG	 ssh-add  ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa
2018-05-04 22:47:55	MG	and finally
2018-05-04 22:47:56	MG	bundle install
2018-05-04 22:48:05	MG	ok so I'm really naive
2018-05-04 22:48:16	MG	on my mac obviously I have my  ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa
2018-05-04 22:48:26	MG	but I'm trying to not put that key into the container
2018-05-04 22:48:38	MG	so hoe do I get that into the container from jenkins
2018-05-04 22:48:50	teletype	you shouldn't have to worry about it
2018-05-04 22:49:31	MG	I don't ?
2018-05-04 22:49:48	teletype	are you using declarative pipeline?
2018-05-04 22:50:04	teletype	actually it shouldn't even matter
2018-05-04 22:50:09	MG	you had me do this on my mac ->  ssh-add  ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa
2018-05-04 22:50:20	MG	and what I'm saying is ... that file ... isn't on my container
2018-05-04 22:50:21	teletype	yes that registers your key w/ ssh-agent
2018-05-04 22:50:26	teletype	no it doesn't need to be

2018-05-04 22:51:05	teletype	yeah i do this for my puppet deployments

2018-05-04 22:59:04	MG	and when I say "deploy to AWS" ... I mean I create the subnet... the VMs in that subnet... set up the swarm manager and workers ... and then do a docker stack deploy
2018-05-04 22:59:15	teletype	sent you a very basic pipeline i just used as a test
2018-05-04 22:59:35	MG	the thing I'm going to investigate after this little problem ... is docker is msupporting kubernetes ... so just in case they ever drop swarm
2018-05-04 22:59:43	teletype	when i run that in a job, i see ssh-add -l output showing the key defined as id test-key in jenkins

2018-05-04 23:00:17	MG	I guess it allows for more disposable environments

2018-05-06 03:06:31	nkuttler	well, you could truncate it.. mind collisions

2018-05-06 04:10:42	tibor_	"maven-box" is name of the job type in Apache Hosted Git Folder, and "maven-surefire" is Git project. It looks line organizational folder.

2018-05-07 01:30:48	MG	I was talking to somewhere here the other night
2018-05-07 01:31:00	MG	and well the thing I'm curious about tonight is
2018-05-07 01:31:19	MG	I have scripted pipelines
2018-05-07 01:31:25	MG	not declarative
2018-05-07 01:31:53	MG	and I wanted to change my "scripted buildpipe" to additionally 'create the build container"
2018-05-07 01:32:16	MG	right now ... I have my build containers already created and sitting out in a docker repo
2018-05-07 01:32:30	MG	my scripted pipeline say node("jdk8")
2018-05-07 01:32:57	MG	and then in turn my jenkins config maps jdk8 to a image out in my docker repo
2018-05-07 01:33:12	MG	I should say the "docker cloud config" in jenkins
2018-05-07 01:33:33	MG	and what this person made me realize is ... what I'm doing is the the difficult way
2018-05-07 01:34:57	MG	that I should define a "Development Environment Dockerfile" ... and then when a webhook kicks off a build ... that the 1st thing my build pipe does is 'build the Development Environment Dockerfile' ... and then run the my build pipe in it
2018-05-07 01:36:07	MG	OR just make my build pipe initially "lookup" the image on local build host and if not there perform 'the image creation" ...
2018-05-07 01:37:01	MG	i'm just not understanding how I tell my build pipe that after it creates this "dev environment image" to start it up and run the rest of my build pipe steps
2018-05-07 01:37:25	MG	I'm the bear with the claws wondering how to get the bunny ...

2018-05-07 01:54:53	anmandel	Just use the image you had just built and put the  things to run in the inside block.

2018-05-07 01:58:32	MG	so to I guess match your example ... I would say ->   docker.image('node: YMD_docker_build_m5xlarge_worker1')
2018-05-07 01:59:07	MG	that's declarative
2018-05-07 01:59:10	MG	I'm using scripted
2018-05-07 02:00:55	MG	ohh I'm reading that page
2018-05-07 02:01:28	anmandel	So you want to run the just built image on a different container?
2018-05-07 02:01:51	MG	no I want to 'build the build container" ... and then use it
2018-05-07 02:02:06	MG	I want to create the image ... that thne I'll run the rest of the build inside of

2018-05-07 02:02:25	MG	I want ANY free node to be able to do this

2018-05-07 02:06:52	MG	oh wait ... are you saying I can have a bunch of machines in my docker cloud config with teh same name ???
2018-05-07 02:07:33	MG	right now each entry in my jenkins docker cloud config has a different name ...
2018-05-07 02:07:56	MG	and I'm just thinking ... I could name these machines based on thier specs ... like t2.xlarge for example ...

2018-05-07 08:19:56	Bebef	We use "dynamic" job configurations via Global Tool Configuration and config file provider plugin and so on. If you want to debug an execution on a slave, you don't have the tools and config files available. Is there a way to preserve the configuration with each execution of the job?
2018-05-07 08:20:28	Bebef	Goal would be that a developer can log onto the slave box and re-execute the job with the least effort.

2018-05-07 12:32:19	@danielbe_	well, that's specific to types implementing Action, but this only matters because an @Extension implementation attaches the action to the build
2018-05-07 12:32:25	@danielbe_	(which is an Actionable)
2018-05-07 12:32:56	@danielbe_	see also https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensibility/
2018-05-07 12:33:19	jeffpearce	e.g. public class CoberturaProjectAction extends Actionable implements ProminentProjectAction
2018-05-07 12:33:20	@danielbe_	so, basically, everything should be anchored by @Extension, or an implementation of the Plugin class (long deprecated)
2018-05-07 12:33:35	jeffpearce	So the important part is that it extends Actionable

Technically you can do everything using a Jenkins Job, Trigger-with-parameters plugin, and Sidebar Links which wraps invocation into a fancy UI. +/-. Maybe there are easier ways, but it depends on which access you have to the server from Jenkins

2018-05-09 14:30:43	Guest19042	let me try that in 15secs
2018-05-09 14:32:22	Guest19042	new Date(millis).toString()  --> this return like Wed May 09 18:38:35 UTC 2018
2018-05-09 14:32:29	musigma	if it's in a jenkinsfile, you'll need to import java.time.Instant
2018-05-09 14:32:48	musigma	yeah, Date's format is stupid. try out java.time.Instant.ofEpochMilli(millis).toString()

2018-05-09 14:38:29	dnusbaum	musigma: it's kind of like JEP-200, rather than whitelisting everything safe the idea is to whitelist some common stuff and then discourage any more complex uses, but provide users a way to add stuff to the whitelist as needed
2018-05-09 14:39:20	musigma	would it be more appropriate to put this type of code in a shared library then? or does that also get put through the security filter?

2018-05-09 14:43:53	dnusbaum	Guest19042: Yes you could create a global shared library with some common utility methods, but I think you should be able to whitelist just the one which would be easier (trying to find the exact link for it).

2018-05-09 18:50:30	Ezro_	Actually, Anticlaus, do you know how I can pass the socket into my container? I may give that a go first since I already have everything else configured.
2018-05-09 18:53:02	Anticlaus	Yeah, you just mount it in. it's at like /var/run/docker.sock or something, give me a sec and I can tell you the path
2018-05-09 18:54:39	Ezro_	I'm digging around on my server for the docker.sock file, but can't seem to find it
2018-05-09 18:55:08	Anticlaus	yeah, /var/run/docker.sock
2018-05-09 18:55:20	Anticlaus	so just -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
2018-05-09 18:55:29	Ezro_	Derp. I don't know how the heck I missed that.
2018-05-09 18:55:41	Ezro_	Let me give that a go and hope I don't blow away all my prod containers. lol
2018-05-09 18:55:57	Anticlaus	I mean, Jenkins isn't gonna do that
2018-05-09 18:55:57	tang^	bewm
2018-05-09 18:56:22	Anticlaus	you might if you run some dodgy ass scripted pipeline, but you'd have to try pretty hard I think
2018-05-09 18:56:24	Ezro_	Should I expect Jenkins to automagically be able to run docker commands once I pass that in?
2018-05-09 18:56:38	Anticlaus	believe so, yeah
2018-05-09 18:56:56	Anticlaus	Although
2018-05-09 18:57:06	Anticlaus	I don't know what docker commands the master actually runs
2018-05-09 18:57:15	Anticlaus	Does declarative pipeline interface with docker directly?

2018-05-09 18:58:06	Anticlaus	I just run the docker commands themselves in scripted pipeline, which means sh steps, i.e they're executed on the agents, not the master

2018-05-09 19:02:07	Anticlaus	the proscribed path is pipelines, of the declarative variety
2018-05-09 19:02:30	Anticlaus	I prefer scripted because it's jst a big ol' groovy script

2018-05-09 19:02:57	Anticlaus	yes
2018-05-09 19:02:58	tang^	proscribed means prohibited
2018-05-09 19:03:05	Anticlaus	was just about to correct myself
2018-05-09 19:03:12	tang^	English, eh?
2018-05-09 19:03:16	Ezro_	By scripted you mean that your whole jenkins "job" is just a single script?
2018-05-09 19:03:51	Anticlaus	Euhhhh, yeah. Sort of. The pipeline paradigm is essentially: Jenkins jobs as code
2018-05-09 19:04:06	Anticlaus	You have a Jenkinsfile in some repo, and that describes exactly what Jenkins does
2018-05-09 19:04:07	tang^	scripted is more freeform, declarative is more opinionated... both are Jenkinsfile Groovy scripts, though

2018-05-10 10:11:30	tang^	yeah
2018-05-10 10:12:02	tang^	so, what you need to do is configure your JDKs in the Manage Jenkins, Global Tool Configuration
2018-05-10 10:12:19	tang^	Then you can use those JDKs in your projects
2018-05-10 10:14:11	rmk0	is it possible that i could set things up so that there's essentially one node per platform/jdk combination? like "macOS/jdk8" "macOS/jdk9" "linux/jdk9" "linux/jdk10" "freebsd/jdk8" and so on?
2018-05-10 10:14:27	tang^	given your requirement for "a range of platforms and JDKs", you're probably looking into what the Matrix plugin can offer
2018-05-10 10:14:39	tang^	absolutely
2018-05-10 10:15:16	tang^	configure each node to only accept jobs assigned to it and give it labels to meet your needs
2018-05-10 10:16:07	tang^	I have two windows nodes, one of which is a win10 node
2018-05-10 10:16:13	musigma	I thought the matrix plugin was outdated and you were supposed to use the equivalent pipeline
2018-05-10 10:17:06	tang^	"windows" jobs will go to either node, "win10" jobs will only go to the win10 node
2018-05-10 10:17:12	rmk0	in my case, i'd only have a few separate machines/vms but each machine or vm would have a range of JDKs installed... i'm not entirely clear on how i would tell jenkins that each vm/jdk combination is a separate node
2018-05-10 10:17:27	tang^	musigma: likely true, pipeline usage would be preferred
2018-05-10 10:17:35	rmk0	presumably i'd need to set up multiple agents on each machine
2018-05-10 10:17:53	tang^	rmk0: nah, you tell your job that for this node, use this jdk
2018-05-10 10:18:15	musigma	so for instance, I put together a minimal cross-JDK pipeline for log4j a while ago: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/blob/master/Jenkinsfile
2018-05-10 10:18:44	rmk0	tang^: that sounds like i'd be duplicating a lot of configuration... i have to tell each job about all of the nodes and jdks each time? i have over 60 projects i'd be building regularly
2018-05-10 10:18:53	musigma	I used to use the matrix plugin for that to get windows builds in addition to the typical linux ones
2018-05-10 10:19:09	musigma	rmk0: you'll want to use labels for this I'm sure
2018-05-10 10:19:27	tang^	rmk0: musigma's pipeline is a good example of what you're after
2018-05-10 10:19:29	musigma	helps with selecting appropriate nodes
2018-05-10 10:19:40	 *	rmk0 eyes pipeline
2018-05-10 10:20:07	musigma	we've also got a more complicated one for log4net, though I'm not too familiar with the .net-specific stuff going on in it: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4net/blob/feature/cd-pipeline/Jenkinsfile
2018-05-10 10:20:48	rmk0	quite like the look of this
2018-05-10 10:20:52	musigma	^that pipeline is still under development currently, but it mostly works (seems to be complicated to set up a cross-compiling .net environment)
2018-05-10 10:20:58	tang^	oh, fancy
2018-05-10 10:21:27	musigma	you could probably find some fancy jenkins pipelines inside jenkins itself or some plugins
2018-05-10 10:22:32	musigma	like this awesome one: https://github.com/jenkinsci/support-core-plugin/blob/master/Jenkinsfile

2018-05-10 12:20:42	maryo_	tang^, Thank you
2018-05-10 12:21:05	tang^	your job will know what SCM is used... your pipeline will use what the job configured

2018-05-10 14:42:53	morenoh149	should jenkins run a project's test suite? or should running the test suite be part of docker container build process?
2018-05-10 14:44:04	morenoh149	the advantage of doing it from the container is that it easier to enforce a certain environment (require libs), I think it may be easier to report PRs have failed test if I run the test suite outside of the docker container build process
2018-05-10 14:45:14	@rtyler	morenoh149: typically in my Pipelines the tests run first, then the conatiner is built
2018-05-10 14:46:07	morenoh149	mmm, but this is a node project, and if I have jenkins run the tests then I'd have to remember to install node on jenkins agents everytime, and make sure the version stays insync with the project
2018-05-10 14:46:46	@rtyler	for my projects I use containers for both

2018-05-11 05:54:07	petn-randall	Hi, I'm trying to use the jenkins-ec2-plugin, however I'm having some issues. I've set up a credentials, and jenkins can also spin up ec2 instances. However, all I see is that jenkins is continously spinning up and tearing down ec2 instances, even though it's idle. In the logs I see that it fails to log in via SSH during provisioning, and thus spins up new ones and terminates the old ones.

2018-05-11 05:54:53	petn-randall	So my question is: What steps are needed to put the right SSH key on the ec2 instance? It's not clear for me from the documentation.
2018-05-11 05:55:20	petn-randall	(I kind of assumed the plugin would do that by itself)

2018-05-11 09:47:29	petn-randall	Ok, I got further with debugging my issue. If I add 'sleep 3600' to the init script field of the ec2-plugin config, the instance stays up fine. So what is causing the instance to immediately get terminated? The logs show no errors, and the idle termination time is currently set to 3600 minutes (60 hours).

2018-05-11 14:22:24	intersta1e8	i already am
2018-05-11 14:22:37	tang^	if it's a plugin/step that's failing the build, the plugin/step will set the result... if it's something your deciding is a failure condition, then you need to explicitly set it
2018-05-11 14:23:06	intersta1e8	hmm it's actually some weirdness I guess
2018-05-11 14:23:10	intersta1e8	maybe im overthinking it
2018-05-11 14:23:17	intersta1e8	so previously if tests failed, it would fail the build
2018-05-11 14:23:39	intersta1e8	im now forcing the tests to fail (it was the easiest thing to edit to test the notifications)
2018-05-11 14:23:54	intersta1e8	but that isn't creating an error
2018-05-11 14:24:01	intersta1e8	it just goes directly to the finally block
2018-05-11 14:24:03	intersta1e8	for some reason
2018-05-11 14:24:41	intersta1e8	maybe i need to force a failure there but that really irks me as it previously resulted in errors
2018-05-11 14:25:08	intersta1e8	the only difference is the try block now wrapping it
2018-05-11 14:25:13	intersta1e8	the whole pipeline that is
2018-05-11 14:25:41	intersta1e8	another annoying thing is that try block has changed the behavior of the pipeline ui
2018-05-11 14:25:59	intersta1e8	when the pipeline fails, all stages preceding the failing one remain green
2018-05-11 14:26:04	intersta1e8	where they used to all turn red on a failure
2018-05-11 14:26:18	tang^	a successful stage should be successful
2018-05-11 14:26:42	intersta1e8	that's fine and that makes a lot of sense to me. But that's clearly ambiguous
2018-05-11 14:26:59	intersta1e8	since previously it did not do that before wrapping it in a try block
2018-05-11 14:27:14	tang^	if they weren't being marked as successful before, I'd be more curious at that state. I think
2018-05-11 14:27:33	intersta1e8	that's always been the behavior i've exprienced with scripted pipelines though
2018-05-11 14:27:39	intersta1e8	in the classic UI anyway
2018-05-11 14:27:44	intersta1e8	i don't have a lot of xp with blue ocean
2018-05-11 14:28:18	tang^	blue ocean tries the KISS principle for pipelines
2018-05-11 14:28:37	tang^	I think it does it better than the classic UI

2018-05-14 11:07:10	winlu	can you cancel ongoing builds in the same pr if new commits are pushed? i know about milestones but for those to cancel the new builds would need to 'catch up' to the old ones first
2018-05-14 11:08:09	rpocase	winlu: I think you'd have to have a VERY early milestone to accomplish that. You could reasonably do something like if(env.CHANGE_ID != null) { milestone(1) }

2018-05-14 11:09:14	winlu	but that would mean I could not use other milestones in my jenkinsfile :(
2018-05-14 11:09:43	winlu	the question is if I would need them if I had such a check
2018-05-14 11:10:07	rpocase	I don't think this would preclude you from using milestones elsewhere.
2018-05-14 11:10:36	rpocase	I believe the input to milestone is just an identifier and doesn't necessarily have to be sequential starting from 0/1 (I haven't used them enough to know though)

2018-05-14 12:56:40	dr_peppa	We are using Python to build IIB (IBM Integration Bus) and IBM MDM (Master Data Management)
2018-05-14 12:57:03	dr_peppa	IIB contains ESQL and Java Code, MDM only Java Code
2018-05-14 12:57:13	musigma	oh yikes. well, I can't say that I've ever witnessed a Java project built using Python
2018-05-14 12:57:25	musigma	I've seen Jython scripts for managing Java EE servers, though
2018-05-14 12:57:25	tang^	sounds complex
2018-05-14 12:57:33	dr_peppa	Well it is done by executing a headless Eclipse Bulid

2018-05-14 12:57:45	dr_peppa	No, we are just talking about Build here
2018-05-14 12:57:51	musigma	oh well that makes a bit more sense, but I think you'd be better off using maven or even ant
2018-05-14 12:57:52	dr_peppa	No Deployment or so
2018-05-14 12:58:19	dr_peppa	The guy who implemented it, new only Python and did not want to learn ANT or another "language"
2018-05-14 12:58:21	musigma	however, it's possible that python was used to integrate with some proprietary APIs
2018-05-14 12:58:24	tang^	IBM is pretty enamoured with Eclipse
2018-05-14 12:58:45	musigma	ohhh, well in that case, I think you would be better off if you can migrate to maven or ant or gradle or even bazel
2018-05-14 12:59:06	dr_peppa	I see. I just don't get the difference
2018-05-14 12:59:20	dr_peppa	What is the advantage of using a build tool like that vs Python
2018-05-14 12:59:30	-->	chrisw (~chrisw@188.29.164.32.threembb.co.uk) has joined #jenkins
2018-05-14 12:59:40	musigma	the big difference between, say, maven and python, is that maven is declarative and more configuration based, while python is more of a script, so each build will be unique
2018-05-14 12:59:56	dnusbaum	boxrick: Once the view exists you can POST XML data to JENKINS_HOST/view/Foo/config.xml to change the entire configuration. Depending on what exactly you want to change about the view there might be a better way than just overwriting the whole config though
2018-05-14 13:00:05	musigma	essentially, maven helps you maintain consistency along with repeatable builds, that sort of thing
2018-05-14 13:00:29	musigma	dr_peppa: here's a good overview: http://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html
2018-05-14 13:00:48	dr_peppa	musigma: I can use python in that way, too. Write a config file (xml, yaml, json, ini) and let that be read by the python script
2018-05-14 13:01:15	musigma	when you do that, you've invented a declarative build system. I think bazel is one such python tool
2018-05-14 13:01:32	dr_peppa	Well, what it does is the following:
2018-05-14 13:02:08	dr_peppa	Bamboo calls create_barfile.py -> Executes a headless build of a certain eclipse workspace which has been pulled from git
2018-05-14 13:02:22	dr_peppa	script executes, then calls next step
2018-05-14 13:02:31	dr_peppa	override_bar.py
2018-05-14 13:02:43	dr_peppa	this again executes headless eclipse build
2018-05-14 13:02:44	musigma	perhaps this might help: your existing build is tied to eclipse which makes it hard to develop outside eclipse. when using maven, you can use any tool you want
2018-05-14 13:02:55	musigma	which still includes eclipse
2018-05-14 13:03:21	dr_peppa	yes, but the whole software (IIB) is tied to eclipse (in fact the IIB toolkit which is eclipse)

2018-05-14 13:04:26	dr_peppa	Under these circumstances
2018-05-14 13:05:05	musigma	oh yeah, IBM, grrr
2018-05-14 13:05:31	musigma	well, one advantage maven has is critical mass. it's far easier to onboard developers with maven than it is using a custom build system
2018-05-14 13:05:58	musigma	and unlike in the javascript ecosystem, popular java libraries tend to be stable and well supported

2018-05-14 13:07:36	musigma	however, it does sound like you may be tied to eclipse anyways, so if you were to switch to maven, you'd need to find equivalent maven plugins for your use case. the disadvantage there is that if you don't have a plugin for what you need, you'll need to learn a bit about maven to write a plugni for it
2018-05-14 13:09:05	dr_peppa	musigma: I see your point
2018-05-14 13:09:33	srl295	fwiw (and IBMer here, hi) eclipse and maven work fine, I checkin `.project` stuff and `pom.xml` at the same time. Then, code can be built by maven on the command line, and eclipse treats the project as a maven project and you can have gui stuff
2018-05-14 13:09:57	musigma	it's definitely hard to say definitely which system is more appropriate for you. it may be useful to switch to maven just to make it more maintainable, but that really depends on whether or not you can configure it properly
2018-05-14 13:09:57	dr_peppa	the critical mass aspect sounds very clear. I'm just in the position to make a decision if we should keep the old python implementation or switch to something like ant or maven
2018-05-14 13:10:38	musigma	I'd suggest maven unless this ibm system requires a bunch of non-maven jars and custom build steps
2018-05-14 13:10:58	musigma	at that point, ant becomes easier because ant is more like make in that sense
2018-05-14 13:11:17	dr_peppa	hi srl295
2018-05-14 13:11:28	dr_peppa	musigma: yes I would also tend to ant

2018-05-14 13:12:17	musigma	maven will integrate better with IDEs and tools than ant, so that's also something to consider, but this existing python build system doesn't sound like it integrates with any IDEs anyways
2018-05-14 13:12:23	dr_peppa	another point is, that we need to make changes to the code before building (which is quite nice if you do it in a python script) like changing the version string or deleting some part depending on the environment for which we build
2018-05-14 13:12:48	musigma	maven has profiles which you can use for environment-specific configurations, plugins, etc.
2018-05-14 13:13:12	dr_peppa	the developers use a custom build.xml (ant) to build the workspace. however, the build server uses python
2018-05-14 13:13:16	musigma	version strings are managed inside the maven config (pom.xml) file which is also automatically changeable. it's a core-like feature of maven (see maven-release-plugin)
2018-05-14 13:13:39	musigma	oh yikes, there's another advantage of going maven (or even ant): using the same build on dev machines and in CI/CD
2018-05-14 13:14:02	dr_peppa	that's not possible
2018-05-14 13:14:10	musigma	I've worked on a project in the past using proprietary libraries that had a dual build system going on due to silly choices like that. we had an ant build for developers and a gradle build for the CI server. was a mess]
2018-05-14 13:14:10	@rtyler	DOCKERDOCKERDOCKER xD
2018-05-14 13:14:29	dr_peppa	we need to build a full package on each build for all environments. the devs build on their machines only parts of those artifacts
2018-05-14 13:14:56	musigma	a maven project is made up of modules, so you can do something similar there
2018-05-14 13:14:57	srl295	actually on my system `mvn` is an alias to `docker run…`
2018-05-14 13:15:15	musigma	hmm, `mvn` is a symlink to the latest version of maven for me, go homebrew

2018-05-14 13:32:59	musigma	I generally aim for my docker container to have somewhere around 1.35x the memory as my -Xmx setting to allow for overhead for the kernel and various parts of java that are not in the heap

2018-05-14 13:44:03	musigma	it is weird, but after using it for like a week or two, I was like, C is dead to me now, Go is way better (except you can't manually manage memory as far as I can tell)
2018-05-14 13:44:44	musigma	having slices and maps built in to the language helps write safer programs
2018-05-14 13:44:59	bitwiseman	musigma: and manual memory control that is debatable as "feature".
2018-05-14 13:45:05	bitwiseman	for most peopel.
2018-05-14 13:45:11	musigma	and it's nice to see a programming language use utf-8 encoding by default instead of all these languages which use UTF-16 or whatever
2018-05-14 13:45:21	realies	maybe i'll start using it someday
2018-05-14 13:45:38	musigma	oh yeah, it'd just be nice to be able to go into a manual mode for certain libraries and whatnot. same for java honestly
2018-05-14 13:46:24	bitwiseman	but generally it causes more problems than it solves.

2018-05-14 14:12:17	sarcher	Is there a way to get a remote build agent running on a windows box?
2018-05-14 14:12:31	sarcher	I setup Jenkins on linux, but I'd like it to manage some builds on windows systems.
2018-05-14 14:12:46	musigma	I know it's possible in theory since builds.apache.org has some windows nodes
2018-05-14 14:13:02	sarcher	I was using java web start and it was really easy. I don't see that option anymore though.
2018-05-14 14:13:08	sarcher	It's still documented though.
2018-05-14 14:13:20	sarcher	https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-LaunchagentviaJavaWebStart
2018-05-14 14:14:14	sarcher	I also don't see the WMI+DCOM method either. I wonder if it moved to a plugin or something.
2018-05-14 14:14:21	musigma	I think Oracle is deprecating javaws for some reason
2018-05-14 14:14:33	musigma	replaced with static java builds or docker containers or something
2018-05-14 14:14:42	xmj	on windows?
2018-05-14 14:14:57	xmj	don't bet the farm on it..
2018-05-14 14:14:59	musigma	windows supports containers nowadays
2018-05-14 14:15:11	tang^	sarcher: that's a build agent
2018-05-14 14:15:14	musigma	not like I've ever tried using it, though, but docker supposedly supports windows containers
2018-05-14 14:15:33	xmj	i can see oracle ship openjdk in a docker container, and call it innovation..
2018-05-14 14:15:42	tang^	java web start is still available from Jenkins
2018-05-14 14:15:54	musigma	I mean oracle deprecating java web start itself

2018-05-14 14:18:12	musigma	come to think of it, some videogame developers use jenkins, and that's usually windows-based builds, so I know it's supported

2018-05-14 15:47:54	FatBoyXPC	Also - I built up a docker-compose.yml to run my tests in, our production environment is running some old versions of the software we use. I noticed that jenkins supports a Dockerfile agent and a docker agent, where I can specify the image name and other things. Since I'm trying to do things "the docker way" and have a mysql container and a php container, I'm using docker-compose to wire it up easily. Is
2018-05-14 15:47:56	FatBoyXPC	there a way to do this in a jenkins agent outside of something like post { always {sh 'docker-compose down'} }?

2018-05-14 16:21:56	timeless	yes
2018-05-14 16:21:58	xmj	likely with a bigger price tag :-p
2018-05-14 16:22:19	pbandark	yes it seems so. i am new to bitbucket. so wondering if its possible to use the above plugin with bitbucket server
2018-05-14 16:22:21	timeless	https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-rebrand-faq-779298912.html Bitbucket Server (previously known as Stash) fits into any enterprise environment because it can be deployed within existing infrastructure or on hosted infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services.
2018-05-14 16:23:01	@danielbeck	pbandark right, so I'd be very surprised if this would work as you expect
2018-05-14 16:23:07	xmj	if you run bitbucket server you probably also run LDAP/AD and want to have it authed through that

2018-05-14 16:24:29	pbandark	xmj so you mean, with bitbucket server, we should integrate AD/LDAP for authentication and use role jenkins plugin for authorization ?
2018-05-14 16:24:57	pbandark	no any other option than above ^^

2018-05-14 17:00:05	@danielbeck	timeless well, you could attempt to answer, or argue it's irrelevant and out of scope and hope others agree with you

2018-05-14 17:53:01	timeless	of course, these days, my build nodes are usually offline, so i can't really blame jenkins for not having a strategy for cleaning them up when i delete jobs

2018-05-14 18:05:13	tang^	oh, not quiet time
2018-05-14 18:05:25	tang^	sounds like that's more like "waiting for agent to start up"
2018-05-14 18:06:03	FatBoyXPC	tang^: no, just on develop right now, but that is the default branch. The branch I pushed a commit to was me merging develop back into the feature branch, and that merg is what gave the branch the Jenkinsfile
2018-05-14 18:06:09	timeless	based on my logs, my guess is that "Waiting for next available executor on " is the case when a node is booting
2018-05-14 18:06:16	timeless	or when a node isn't available

2018-05-14 18:12:43	tang^	that's a good question FatBoyXPC. most of my options work has been on single branch pipelines so I know about the delay in changing settings... making settings work on multibranch pipelines is going to be different
2018-05-14 18:13:20	tang^	once you have this option change in all your core branches, and PRs are based off branches with those changes present, then it should work properly

2018-05-14 19:10:21	+Slide-O-Mix	Stormmore: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/
2018-05-14 19:10:25	Stormmore	tang^, they have already said there is no support for Gerrit but there is a ticket for it now at least. However, I am well aware how long that might before it is implemented
2018-05-14 19:10:29	FatBoyXPC	well, they are, but the docker compose stuff I'm doing is making this less than ideal
2018-05-14 19:10:38	tang^	Stormmore: jenkins groovy is an opinionated subset of groovy
2018-05-14 19:11:07	Stormmore	Slide-O-Mix, yes I know about shared libraries but apparently my groovy code doesn't work due to the "opinionated" groovy Jenkins uses
2018-05-14 19:11:16	tang^	FatBoyXPC: sounds like you need multiple repos rather than multiple branches
2018-05-14 19:11:23	TobiX	FatBoyXPC: Why do ypu want to disallow concurrent builds? Do you have some resources that need to be accessed exclusivly?
2018-05-14 19:11:33	+Slide-O-Mix	Stormmore: shared libraries are much closer to "regular" groovy
2018-05-14 19:11:51	tang^	less opinions in scripted pipelines and shared libraries
2018-05-14 19:11:57	Stormmore	tang^, yeah and it is driving me nuts since the documentation doesn't really help in these situations. Google isn't very friendly cause I keep gettings links back to the docs that haven't helped yet
2018-05-14 19:12:04	+Slide-O-Mix	you can define your own steps and so forth
2018-05-14 19:12:28	tang^	Stormmore: it sounds like you've hit a unique edge case and need to start raising issues so the various devs can be aware of them
2018-05-14 19:12:51	Stormmore	tang^, I have but I can't wait for them to fix their stuff

2018-05-14 19:13:13	FatBoyXPC	TobiX: i decided to run my tests inside a docker container. My tests also depend on mysql, so I have 2 containers (tryng to do things the 'docker way'). I can't use the docker or dockerfile agent because I've got 2 containers, so I'm using docker-compose and manually calling it from bash in the jenkins steps.
2018-05-14 19:13:44	FatBoyXPC	TobiX: post { always { docker-compose down} } - that seems to still bring down the mysql container running in the other build that's running :(

2018-05-14 19:14:05	tang^	Stormmore: ah, half a step ahead of the devs with different priorities
2018-05-14 19:14:18	tang^	Stormmore: which issue #s?
2018-05-14 19:14:50	TobiX	FatBoyXPC: So your builds are stepping on each others toes - maybe better fix that then? Create random container IDs?
2018-05-14 19:15:26	TobiX	I'm not familiar with docker-compose, but AFAIR in the kubernetes plugin, pods from different jobs are independent...
2018-05-14 19:15:31	FatBoyXPC	TobiX: well, that's happening, but if I run 2 builds at once it really slows down, takes over 2x as long (only have 2gb ram box for jenkins)
2018-05-14 19:15:53	FatBoyXPC	TobiX: well I'm not using the docker plugin, maybe that would give some affordances

2018-05-14 19:17:06	FatBoyXPC	TobiX: If I set that to 1 would that fix this concurrent build problem? :D
2018-05-14 19:17:08	tang^	or when you look at the Build Executor Status, how many are listed?

2018-05-14 19:17:27	Stormmore	tang^, https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/784 is the Jenkins X one

2018-05-14 19:18:00	tang^	Stormmore: you're not using any of the Gerrit plugins?
2018-05-14 19:18:04	FatBoyXPC	Jesus I'm filling up my disk space way too fast, I'm starting to think docker was a bad idea
2018-05-14 19:18:10	FatBoyXPC	i've had to clear it twice today
2018-05-14 19:18:23	tang^	docker images can get hefty, yes
2018-05-14 19:18:36	FatBoyXPC	# of executors is 2
2018-05-14 19:18:38	Stormmore	tang^, oh I am trying too but it is piss poor in comparison to github, bitbucket, etc
2018-05-14 19:18:41	FatBoyXPC	so I can put this to 1 and solve all my problems?
2018-05-14 19:19:07	+Slide-O-Mix	well, not ALL of your problems, but the immediate one most likely :)
2018-05-14 19:19:08	tang^	FatBoyXPC: if your issue is your node doesn't have enough resources to run more than one job at a time, then set it to 1
2018-05-14 19:19:41	tang^	Stormmore: there are several and Gerrit isn't nearly as widely used as the others you listed

2018-05-15 04:08:57	drichtar	PTO?
2018-05-15 04:10:40	jimklimov	ronzy: the error means that a reverse proxy (apache, nginx, squd, etc.) facing the users did not get the response from origin server (jenkins) within the timeout set up in the proxy
2018-05-15 04:11:38	jimklimov	so you might be able to go into the jenkins webapp server directly (deployed e.g. on port 8080 often, though might be bound to server localhost)
2018-05-15 04:12:12	jimklimov	or configure the proxy to relax the timeouts to many minutes rather than few seconds for the jenkins URI namespace
2018-05-15 04:12:28	ronzy	jimklimov: OK thanks. Maybe I could do a test and temporary set a higher timeout on nginx
2018-05-15 04:13:00	ronzy	correct ... will do that and check it out. Thank you jimklimov
2018-05-15 04:13:16	jimklimov	the *Gateway* timeout is the giveaway BTW ;)

2018-05-15 13:22:23	yobalt	but if we want to create a shared library with specific scenario, to be reused. that save us from declaring on each stage the when block.
2018-05-15 13:22:39	yobalt	for example a
2018-05-15 13:22:45	yobalt	def masterPipeline(String step, Closure closure) {   if ("master" == env.BRANCH_NAME) {     stage(step, closure)   } }
2018-05-15 13:22:59	yobalt	that was for scripted pipelines.
2018-05-15 13:23:23	tang^	you should be able to do that for declarative, too
2018-05-15 13:23:47	yobalt	I think declarative only allows custom steps
2018-05-15 13:23:50	tang^	shared libraries work for both pipelines
2018-05-15 13:24:10	yobalt	i tried for stages but unsuccessfully

2018-05-15 13:26:09	yobalt	that is an example. In that way the pipeline ui only shows and execute the specific cases based on master or pullrequest criteria.

2018-05-15 15:20:24	Stormmore	I am reading conflicting information about whether it works or not in a shared library
2018-05-15 15:20:32	musigma	like in a pipeline? would love to hear how since I wanted to unit test my pipeline without an entire build for it
2018-05-15 15:21:03	Stormmore	musigma, hadn't even thought about that idea ;-)
2018-05-15 15:21:16	Stormmore	just really tired of JSON objects, tbh
2018-05-15 15:22:31	Stormmore	I found https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41122 but doesn't really explain what the user was seeing
2018-05-15 15:22:32	jenkins-admin	JENKINS-41122:@Grab does not work when libraries are scoped to folders (Resolved) https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41122

2018-05-15 15:32:46	Stormmore	that is interesting, just like in that ticket, I was about to get the library to work if I defined it at the global level. Testing to see if I can define it at the folder level too
2018-05-15 15:33:10	Stormmore	but definitely can't just have it defined in a folder scope only

2018-05-15 19:03:44	dgarzon	Hi, I am developing and extension using the org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.flow.GraphListener extension point. I extended this interface, implemented the onNewHead method, and added the @Extension annotation to the implementation class. Now, I would like to test my implementation with the JenkinsRule, but it is not picking it up. Is there anything I need to do to get the JenkinsRule to register my extension?

I'm using SonarCube on the web (sonarcloud.io) and it works great. It analysed my project from the github repo and told me some bugs. Now I've corrected the bugs and I have commited the changes, but sonarcube didn't analyse the new project... Can you guys tell me how can I tell it to "re-analyse" the project? Thank

2018-05-16 01:05:41	thejester	 I have a build foo_1, that generated foo_1.txt and i have a build foo_2 that generates foo_2.txt. Now the idea was to make them run in parallel each night by making use of a pipeline. The pipeline Syntax page suggests using build 'foo1' and build 'foo2'. Is this a good idea or am i missing or mixing up things ?
2018-05-16 01:05:51	thejester	and... when that is working.... could i append a foo_3 to the pipeline that makes use of the foo_{1/2}.txt files ?

2018-05-16 10:34:45	drichtar	jglick, Hello, can we chat here? I am extending your workflow-step-api-plugin. I have an issue that I don't which method to call when my pipeline is done and I need to do one more thing
2018-05-16 10:35:03	drichtar	*that I don't know
2018-05-16 10:36:26	+jglick	Best to use the Jenkins dev list and give full context for your question including source code links and a statement of your concrete goal.
2018-05-16 10:36:38	drichtar	All right
2018-05-16 10:37:27	+jglick	There are many others who could likely answer; it is not “my” plugin.

2018-05-16 10:39:59	Vaivars	rtyler - the issue is that there isn't a way to resume failed pipelines from some state - e.g .if you have a pipeline that is 10 stages, and it breaks at stage 6 because some connection error (unrelated to the actual pipeline) or w.e - you have to run it from the begining
2018-05-16 10:41:15	Vaivars	So i am trying to figure a way how to essentially bypass already executed stages in some way (and since we do a roll-forward way of working - rollbacks are not an issue). Hence why i am looking to register the state somewhere. If theres a better solution - i am all ears
2018-05-16 10:41:28	Vaivars	Also sorry for the delay, was in transit
2018-05-16 10:41:43	@rtyler	no worries
2018-05-16 10:42:01	@rtyler	what you describe is a feature that CloudBees has sold to their customers on top fo Pipeline called `checkpoints` for what its worth
2018-05-16 10:42:18	Vaivars	Yup, that i know, but it is prohibitively expensive :D
2018-05-16 10:42:59	@rtyler	you should send Jenn an email then :P https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/04/18/blueocean-1-5-0/

2018-05-16 13:59:37	dgarzon	jglick Thanks! Unfortunately, I am using the entry point here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-api-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/flow/GraphListener.java, which does not expose the `EnvVars` argument. Is there any other way to get those variables?

2018-05-16 17:44:42	MG	so you are saying the type of cred should be "secret" file ...

2018-05-16 17:54:26	jiangty	hi, I want to hard kill a job that's not being aborted. The problem is: its log is enormous (160GB due to some weird log spam), so I can't see the "force abort" option that usually appears at the end of the log
2018-05-16 17:54:42	jiangty	when I try to view `/console`, it times out :')
2018-05-16 17:55:09	Anticlaus	jiangty: there's some script nonsense you can run in the Jenkins console to kill the job by name, there's at least one stackoverflow question that has it
2018-05-16 17:55:57	MG	I was wondering if I need to get the 'hub cert so that I can get my images into the cluster" on every node in the swarm kluster ... or if the only person that needed the cert is the swarm manager
2018-05-16 17:56:23	Anticlaus	Ah, I'm not really sure how docker swarm works
2018-05-16 17:56:50	Anticlaus	Is that for uploading your docker image?
2018-05-16 17:56:56	MG	yes
2018-05-16 17:57:09	MG	downloading it actually into the deployment cluster
2018-05-16 17:57:31	MG	in swarm ... you have a manager ... and workers that are labelled behind it
2018-05-16 17:57:58	MG	you do a "stack deploy" and if you set the deployment desciriopt up right the works grab the images off your hub account
2018-05-16 17:58:04	Anticlaus	You don't really have to worry about registry authentication in kubernetes. You can run a cluster-local image registry if you want, or if you use a decent cloud platform like AWS or GCP, k8s works pretty nicely natively with their container solutions

2018-05-16 18:17:21	tang^	so, yeah, ahead of the game, you are
2018-05-16 18:17:47	MG	like if my hub key was compromused ok ... I update the hub key ... and then update the secret file cred for that in jenkins
2018-05-16 18:18:00	MG	I should say "hub cert"
2018-05-16 18:18:36	MG	and then all the machiens that I have out there ... it's like yeah they have "the old cert" that won't matter cause I'd have already changed it on my hub account
2018-05-16 18:19:15	MG	when I do a new deploy (to new VMs) the new cert would get put down on those VMs ... cause the new cert would be in the jenins cred store
2018-05-16 18:19:49	MG	hopefully that is the right idea :) let's hope I never have to test it out :)
2018-05-16 18:19:49	MG	lol

2018-05-17 04:17:44	jimklimov	hi all, some time ago, maybe after ungraceful restart of master by "yum update" (not sure of that) many MultiJob sub-jobs are shown as gray "Pending" in the multijob's main page (overview of current/last run). Clicking into a particular build we see the states okay, but the overview is very misleading, hiding the green/red balls with gray areas. Can this be fixed somehow? Some backend FS files to hack?

2018-05-17 04:34:15	DevAntoine	I want to populate a select parameter (I'm using Extensible Choice Parameter plugin with the groovy script parameter) using a file which is in a Git Repo.
2018-05-17 04:34:22	DevAntoine	I've done this: return new File(project.getWorkspace().toString() + '/hosts').readLines();
2018-05-17 04:35:02	DevAntoine	It's kinda working: at the first build the dropdown is empty because there's no workspace so there's no "hosts" file but at the second build it works.
2018-05-17 04:35:52	DevAntoine	Thing is: each time I update this hosts file I have to run an empty build to checkout the new version of the hosts file.
2018-05-17 04:35:59	DevAntoine	Is there a better way of doing this?

2018-05-17 04:49:05	Yo_tothe_tam	What im getting in the actual message is "${BUILD_ID} finished successfully"

Is that possible? The goal is to have a common pipeline where can integrate any SCM tools by

So it I can trigger the job from the beginning with the correct id and without trying on parameters that could be a solution. Otherwise I can trigger it with a parameter but then I need to update the commit so that it matches the correct one on blue ocean.

2018-05-18 14:04:40	dnusbaum	samuel: the repo that has the packages is jenkinsci/packaging. This file seems most relevant, but doesn't have exactly what you mentioned: https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging/blob/stable-2.73/rpm/build/SOURCES/jenkins.init.in
2018-05-18 14:04:59	dnusbaum	How did you install Jenkins?

2018-05-18 14:11:09	samuel	ah I thought the systemd config came from the rpm, but that packaging repo script looks more like an init.d script
2018-05-18 14:11:35	samuel	that systemd config is created by the puppet module https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-jenkins/blob/master/templates/jenkins-run.erb
2018-05-18 14:14:04	dnusbaum	Interesting
2018-05-18 14:15:22	dnusbaum	Since that repo is not under the jenkinsci org, there's not a lot we can do for your Jira ticket. I would probably open an issue/pr on that repo directly

2018-05-21 04:59:29	jimklimov	Hi all, we have a github organization job to set up multibranch pipeline jobs for repos it finds in an organization. Now some GH testing repos were removed, and the scanning job encounters a REST API error while looking for new data about the repo - and so it lingers in our setup (does not get disabled/deleted like would happen for e.g. removed branches in a repo).
2018-05-21 04:59:51	-->	_ADN_ (~username@5.148.34.186) has joined #jenkins
2018-05-21 05:00:19	jimklimov	I guess this is a failsafe behavior for the case of HTTP errors, but if the REST API listing of repos succeeds and the repo is not there - shouldn't it be a trigger for (instant or delayed) removal of the MBP setup?

2018-05-21 05:01:07	jimklimov	Regarding delayed removal - in our case we actually killed a working repo, set up a repo-tmp recreated from a fork, then github support restored our original so we killed off the repo-tmp
2018-05-21 05:01:15	jimklimov	now we have jobs for both in Jenkins :)

2018-05-21 07:23:07	+ogondza	drulli, It does not seem to be from https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-fixtures so I guess it must have been released in registry if that ever worked
2018-05-21 07:23:18	jimklimov1	on a side note, that job announced one failed build - the first build for a newly branch with a Jenkinsfile, which generally fails for all (our?) builds so only the second+ have a chance to succeed; is there any logged bug about that? Maybe Jenkins should unconditionally re-schedule the "failed first build" jobs?
2018-05-21 07:24:46	jimklimov1	actually, similar effect is seen with changes to Jenkinsfile (e.g. declaring and then using new build arguments), so if Jenkins so far has issues coping with such redefinitions on the fly, the "first" build for the usecase above should be a "failed first build after detecting that Jenkinsfile content changed since last run" (including the trivial case of initially null content for true first builds)

2018-05-21 08:38:21	jimklimov	is there some sort of view that would allow filtering instances of the same job by their build parameters? e.g. we run the same test definition against different product variants, and want to see how each variant performed under test (doing this via pipeline and thusly generated jobs would be clumsy maintenance-wise, although we consider the option if nothing else helps)
2018-05-21 08:41:16	jimklimov	we tried the ParameterFilter, but it seems that it allows to select all job definitions that have such parameter set to such values sometime in the past X builds - so we end up with the same lists and "latest" results in all variants

2018-05-21 09:02:28	rvallel	We have firewalls, etc. But connectivity thou not super-fast falls within normal. What it is very strange to me, is that for example "npm install" command will not use any CPU, and when I run independently thanks 100% sustained.

2018-05-21 09:18:50	jimklimov	no idea on that
2018-05-21 09:19:05	jimklimov	I assume the agent should be same, and transport layers/libs are different
2018-05-21 09:21:38	rvallel	jimklimov: thanks for the brainstorm. will continue testing and see if I can find out what is going on.
2018-05-21 09:22:59	jimklimov	good luck :)
2018-05-21 09:23:39	rvallel	thanks!
2018-05-21 09:24:14	jimklimov	one more idea, try to change the jenkins job to execute a shell `set` and print out active envvars (so you can use them to reproduce the same env as the agent imposes), perhaps also executing the job from master over SSH - to have it all as similar as possible
2018-05-21 09:24:36	jimklimov	and maybe wrap the `npm install` with `strace` and/or `time` to profile how that goes
2018-05-21 09:25:01	jimklimov	if it is stuck somewhere, you'd see it as a last line in `strace` output, hopefully

2018-05-21 09:38:54	jimklimov	in our case, all options including NFS to a NAS are similarly rather slow (so I think the issue for us is somewhere in the OS/kernel); our sort of solution to a similar problem was to use the NFS share and offload architecture-agnostic things like unpacking reference buildroots and customizing them by "offline" package installs using SSH to the NAS host (x86) so the heavy I/O happens on the fast machine locally, and then the ARM ones take time doing wha

Even though the job completed successfully, the console log is clearly incomplete but has this curious message:  "Running in Durability level: MAX_SURVIVABILITY"  I found this and will give it a read (https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/scaling-pipeline/)  It might lead to a solution.

2018-05-21 14:21:54	Klindel	we're seeing something really strange, in a scripted pipeline, if we sleep or use the build command with "wait: true" being used within a loop, after the first sleep or build command, the script just exits
2018-05-21 14:22:24	mcsf	OK, here is the concurrency question. When using `docker.withRegistry` and `docker.image(...).inside()` (where the image is obtained from the remote registry), occasionally the build fails with the following error: `sh: /var/lib/jenkins/slave/workspace/*-***@tmp/durable-***/script.sh: not found`.  Adding a `sleep` before calling `docker.image(...).inside()` seems to fix the issue.  These steps are the only contents of the Jenkins stage.

2018-05-21 17:40:46	mcsf	I have a question about global libraries and env vars. We have a library which utilizes this env var: env.BRANCH_NAME.
2018-05-21 17:41:07	mcsf	Before we added this library, we were able to run the same Jenkinsfile in either a Multibranch job or a Pipeline job, and it ran fine in either.
2018-05-21 17:41:19	mcsf	After adding this library, it works in the Multibranch, but dies in the Pipeline.
2018-05-21 17:41:57	mcsf	Ideally, we would like the Jenkinsfile to continue to function successfully when run as a (non-multibranch) Pipeline job.

2018-05-21 18:38:29	jidar	Is there a simple way to copy an artifact from one container to another in a pipeline?
2018-05-21 18:39:44	@rtyler	are they both running on the same agent?
2018-05-21 18:39:59	jidar	yes
2018-05-21 18:40:04	+schristou	jidar: it's probably best to mount a volume
2018-05-21 18:40:53	@rtyler	well, depending on how they're being run, Jenkins may be already mapping the workspace through
2018-05-21 18:40:57	@rtyler	in which case, there's nothing to copy
2018-05-21 18:41:24	jidar	I figured that might also be the case but didn't know if I should use some sort of mapped or registered name
2018-05-21 18:41:39	jidar	ie: upload *.rpm to a remote server
2018-05-21 18:42:01	jidar	let me just try that first
2018-05-21 18:43:34	@rtyler	jidar: how is the container being run in the Pipeline?
2018-05-21 18:44:07	jidar	first image is from a dockerfile
2018-05-21 18:44:22	jidar	second is just a client container (for the software to use S3/object storage)

2018-05-21 23:48:55	StillLearnin	mcsf: the quickest way to find out is to ask the real question for which you want an answer.
2018-05-21 23:49:05	mcsf	haha, thank you
2018-05-21 23:49:15	mcsf	I'm pounding my head against the wall here,
2018-05-21 23:49:21	mcsf	basically, trying to get this to work:
2018-05-21 23:49:30	mcsf	  environment { NUGET_CACHE = ${env.WORKSPACE}\\.nuget\\packages }
2018-05-21 23:49:53	mcsf	also tried this:   environment { NUGET_CACHE = "${env.WORKSPACE}/.nuget/packages }"
2018-05-21 23:50:05	 *	StillLearnin begins pounding head against wall also...
2018-05-21 23:50:12	mcsf	lol
2018-05-21 23:50:21	mcsf	(above line had a typo)
2018-05-21 23:50:37	mcsf	Did a google search and found this: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/41
2018-05-21 23:55:15	StillLearnin	mcsf: try environment { NUGET_CACHE = "${env.WORKSPACE}/.nuget/packages" }
2018-05-21 23:55:42	mcsf	OMG it worked!!!
2018-05-21 23:55:55	StillLearnin	mcsf: or did I just fix the typo?
2018-05-21 23:56:18	mcsf	I think we arrived at the solution about the same time...I set up a test project, and got this to work:
2018-05-21 23:56:25	mcsf	environment { NUGET_CACHE = "${env.WORKSPACE}" }
2018-05-21 23:56:40	mcsf	and just as I was about to append the rest of it, you replied :-)
2018-05-21 23:57:07	 *	StillLearnin stops banging head
2018-05-21 23:58:07	mcsf	Thank you very much!!! It is nearly 9 PM here PST
2018-05-21 23:58:36	StillLearnin	mcsf: nearly 12 here in EST
2018-05-21 23:58:48	mcsf	oh wow. Deadlines?
2018-05-21 23:59:34	StillLearnin	mcsf: you're welcome. no, just winding down with a nice quiet programming session.

Then I got other warnings about old data, and I discarded it. Now I see the jobs I set up lost some steps. I had for example a job which was triggering a build of another job—that step is gone. Any idea where I can find it back? It was tricky to set it up..

2018-05-22 05:47:40	+drulli	hmm, then I don't think that you have a chance to get these configurations back. I don't think that Jenkins stores a backup before writing it to disk
2018-05-22 05:51:12	jimklimov	just in case though, do look for config.xml files (main and in jobs definitions) with an extension, maybe some survived...
2018-05-22 05:51:32	jimklimov	you did not set up a thinbackup plugin either, right? and no filesystem snapshots,etc.
2018-05-22 05:51:40	+oleg-nenashev	minherz jimklimov: "Variables" are fine, but such variables should not be passed as Build parameters. The best way is to rework the plugin to pass an EnvironmentContributingAction when triggering the build. There is also a way to whitelist the parameters from the code if you want to have a quick solution

2018-05-22 05:59:20	jimklimov	oleg-nenashev: looking now more attentively at the list of parameters it does not like, part of the issues can indeed come from our multiphase job setups, where child jobs are called with a list of parameter assignments indeed with little regard to whether those params are accepted by current revision of the child job

2018-05-22 15:07:07	dgarzon	Hi, I am implementing a `GraphListener` which gathers metrics for a pipeline execution. Is there any way to know when a `StepAtomNode` has started and completed? I have gone through the API, and cannot find anything on the matter other than `node.execution.isComplete` which returns boolean. I am looking for some way to add a callback: `onStart` and `onComplete`. Any ideas?

2018-05-22 15:40:05	kaictl	Hi, So I've been trying to no avail to get for loops from a list to work in pipelines. Preferably I'd like to use a for loop inside of the `pipeline`, to create stages and such. If I could get something like the following link to create three stages, foo-a, foo-b, and foo-c, that print out 'a' 'b' and then 'c', that would be amazing.

2018-05-22 17:05:49	hoylemd	Hey folks, I've got a pipeline here that runs my tests via the `invoke` test runner (`invoke tests <args go here>`).  Problem is, in Blue Ocean, the output of the tests doesn't seem to be respecting newlines in the output.  Since the test output lines are < 1/3 the width of my browser window, I see 3 output lines side-by side.  I'm not really sure where to even start on shooting this trouble. Anyone got
2018-05-22 17:05:55	hoylemd	an idea?

2018-05-23 15:07:09	musigma	it depends more so on what you're writing. anything non-trivial doesn't really belong in the Jenkinsfile itself. you can write a shared library which can be reused by multipled Jenkinsfiles, or you can write a Jenkins plugin proper (or modify an existing one) to do the heavy lifting
2018-05-23 15:07:47	musigma	if you write it as a plugin directly, that might work with jython, not sure on how that interoperates with java

2018-05-23 17:20:27	survient	Per the Jenkins documentation I'm checking here to see if a plugin may already exist before I try writing one myself. I basically intend to extend the Jenkins API to publish a json object that contains job configuration information in a format that the Confluence "JSON Table Macro" can understand. The native Jenkins API does not expose the information I'm interested in exporting. Any insight would be appreciated.

2018-05-24 03:51:29	jimklimov	In other cases it seems to still work; I think the difference is that the Editable and Add Edited Value checkboxes are clicked in faulty lists and not clicked in those that work
2018-05-24 03:52:00	jimklimov	so maybe there's some Jeknins Security intervention with plugin's methods?

2018-05-24 04:49:02	raman	jimklimov: so, how are you passing variables to that jenkins file, through global variables or something else? thanks for replying

2018-05-24 04:49:05	jimklimov	so the configurable thing outside the pipeline code (from FOSS upstream) is the name of the job (on this Jenkins instance) used to deploy code
2018-05-24 04:50:06	jimklimov	when a FOSS component finished the tests, it calls the pusher with its intimate site-specific implementation
2018-05-24 04:50:33	jimklimov	in this case, it comes from global variable setup
2018-05-24 04:50:59	jimklimov	and the defaultValue is a verbatim dollar-braces-varname that gets evaluated later on
2018-05-24 04:51:22	jimklimov	if someone specifies a plain string (e.g. job name) in the build args, it is evaluated to unchanged self

2018-05-24 05:01:46	jimklimov	some projects I've seen during research for this solution, used e.g. groovy readFile() or similar methods to read data from a filesystem - which can be planted there by admin or checkout from a separate repo for configs
2018-05-24 05:01:57	jimklimov	they you parse it and make groovy vars from it
2018-05-24 05:02:35	jimklimov	possibly the credential store (scoped) can be used too
2018-05-24 05:02:51	jimklimov	it has a way to store files (aka big secrets)
2018-05-24 05:03:32	jimklimov	at the very least, you can have the user:pass piggybacking a generic key:value

2018-05-24 08:36:23	dwts	Hello all, I'm using jenkins with the pipeline plugin (trying to trigger a rundeck job execution after build job is done). I have a "RundeckNotifier" step in my JenkinsFile but I get an "ERROR: Rundeck configration is invalid". Is there a way to enable more logging so that I get a more informative log of what is not valid?

2018-05-24 10:24:02	waynr	why would jenkins indicate that "No Changes" on a newly-opened PR?
2018-05-24 10:25:01	waynr	I have a multibranch pipeline job created for a PR that I just opened and for the very first build the little square box thing next to the date and time of the first run's build says "No Changes"
2018-05-24 10:25:21	waynr	i think this is leading my "changeset" directives to evaluate false
2018-05-24 10:26:12	waynr	but it's hard to be 100% certain as far as that goes since jenkins says nothing about which part of a given when conditional evaluates true/false
2018-05-24 10:26:42	OltzU	Well, the first build has no way of knowing what it should compare against. The second build will know what has changed in relation to the first one.

2018-05-24 11:38:26	selckin	time spend in gc will get added and other things

2018-05-24 11:40:21	selckin	i'd check nanoTime() and see if the passed
2018-05-24 11:40:39	stephan_	this change is to wait for graceful termination of a job
2018-05-24 11:41:22	stephan_	so instead of a for loop and sleep inside, you want a deadline calculated and then a loop until it with sleep?

2018-05-24 12:03:46	petn-randall	I'm using Jenkins pipes and the ec2-plugin and I'm wondering how to best configure installation dependencies. There's a possibility to configure an "Init script" that runs on each build node, however I'd like to keep that data checked in somewhere in the respective git repo. How do you all do this?

2018-05-24 17:44:50	jaapvermeulen	No, I take that back.  There are 2 issues going on...  What I described above is regarding the JIRA plugin.  I guess I will file an issue for that.  This is the new 3.0 version.
2018-05-24 17:45:22	jaapvermeulen	The other problem is that for one of the builds the GIT changes stopped working about 2 weeks ago.  All other projects show all changes including today.  No idea why that might be.
2018-05-24 17:48:50	jaapvermeulen	Ah, and that last piece is also explained.  So, the only problem is the JIRA plugin.  Never mind...

2018-05-25 10:00:11	tschellenberg	I have a question with pipelines that I'm trying to solve. I need to insert some manual stage gates for software deployment that require a human to click the button. The input directives seem to work well but I'm trying to fix a few side effects with them. Specifically, they keep the build light flashing as though it is still actively building and it appears to be adding the time spent waiting to the overall build time. Is there a way around this?
2018-05-25 10:00:12	tschellenberg	Our builds sometimes remain in the state waiting for human input for a long time (days) and, unfortunately, there's restrictions preventing me from removing the human element. Alternatively, is there a way for me to chain pipelines together or something like that without having separate jobs?

2018-05-25 10:48:48	tschellenberg	Hello, I'm looking for some help trying to setup a pipeline that has some manual stage gates in it and provides clear status in the Jenkins UI. I've tried putting an 'input' statement in a flyweight executor and it pauses the pipeline. However, in most views it still shows the job as 'in progress' and it's not clear that the first stages have completed successfully. Also, it appears to be counting the paused time against the build execution time
2018-05-25 10:48:48	tschellenberg	so you can't get a good idea of how long the builds take vs how long it is stuck waiting for humans.
2018-05-25 10:50:04	tschellenberg	I'm not sure what strategy I should be taking to try and make this work. I could try to use multiple jobs but that would mean that the pipeline view is less useful. Is there a way to chain pipelines or something?

2018-05-25 10:50:41	tschellenberg	The functionality that we used before pipelines was from the promotion plugin where the job would finish and say it's finished but then you could go back later and promote a particular build. I'm trying to do something like that with pipelines.

2018-05-25 10:55:07	rcvu	tschellenberg: I looked into this recently and it looks like the best way to do this with pipelines is to use milestones and inputs
2018-05-25 10:56:21	rcvu	Or you could have a seperate job that promotes the artifacts from your build jobs

2018-05-25 10:58:58	tschellenberg	rcvu: Thanks for the help. I looked at the milestones too and it is something we probably need in a few places. I'll keep digging away at it. I may need to go the additional jobs route or maybe there's a way I can integrate the promotion plugin with the job. That would be okay too.

A pretty common one is to set up reverse proxy (apache, nginx, etc.) and manage HTTPS there. Also you can set up the certs into Java trust storage and manage HTTPS right in the webcontainer (tomcat, glassfish, ...) or in the standalone Jetty - google the page for its many CLI parameters.

In my experience the queue gets cut to the number of executors*workers, so if I have 1 worker with 2 executors I can only set 2 builds in parallel + enqueue only 2 more, enqueuing another one will replace some in existing queue

2018-05-28 09:12:17	abouquet	thanks psiroky for ur quick answer

2018-05-29 03:56:43	OltzU	DevAntoine: you could archive an artifact containing those variables in the build job, and fetch the artifact in deploy.
2018-05-29 03:57:11	DevAntoine	OltzU: what kind of artifact are you talking about and where should I archive it?
2018-05-29 03:57:11	OltzU	Or if those variables can come from somewhere else, just setup the parameters for the job with default values.
2018-05-29 03:57:38	OltzU	A text file containing the variables, but of course only in the case they are coming from the build job.
2018-05-29 03:58:46	OltzU	I've just used the Parameterized Trigger plugin and called the job with parameters I need. Nowadays I just pipeline.

2018-05-29 10:43:59	DevAntoine	my original issue is the following: if my last stage, which is to trigger another job to deploy the artifact, fails, I want the job to be marked as unstable because actually, the build succeed, it's only the deploying phase which failed, and which is not even in my build pipeline, it's just a trigger!
